[1:36pm] mariarahel: rebalancing a little and adding liquidity to the irc token
[1:37pm] hextrack: okay i was like wtf lol
[1:37pm] n2_sales_force: @mariarahel ‚Ä¶ how often to perform a liquidity rebalancing?
[1:37pm] n2_sales_force: do you*
[1:37pm] hextrack: i was so confused..instally lost a couple k
[1:38pm] mariarahel: ideally less and less
[1:39pm] mariarahel: the remaining rebalancings are probably very predictable
[1:39pm] hextrack: my finger is numb getting it $200+ LOL
[1:39pm] mariarahel: ya that seems too high
[1:39pm] hextrack: i was waiting for it but it was unexpected haha
[1:39pm] n2_sales_force: is there a specific pattern or cryteria that you go about with rebalancing? ex: do you start with the highest liquidity tokens and spread them out going down?
[1:40pm] mariarahel: i'm going for a balance sheet on each token that makes it attractive to investors while maintaining a good position vs the actual investment assets
[1:42pm] n2_sales_force: does the reblanacing ever include newly added funds to the system? or just moving around whats currently in there?
[1:42pm] mariarahel: funds were added over the weekend
[1:43pm] n2_sales_force: how often do you guys ‚Äòadd funds‚Äô?
[1:43pm] mariarahel: there is no precise schedule, i did a calculated sale on phex after the bottom was crashed
[1:44pm] mariarahel: almost all of the purchase went into zurich this round
[1:46pm] n2_sales_force: if i am constantly scanning the tokens in my code (liquidty, price, all of it, etc.) ‚Ä¶ is there a way i can detect where/when the rebalancing occurs (any params you can suggest in my queries)?
[1:47pm] mariarahel: you are welcome to subscribe to the transaction log for the originating address
[1:47pm] n2_sales_force: 414 address? sorry what do you mean ‚Äòoriginal address‚Äô?
[1:47pm] mariarahel: ya the address that created all the contracts
[1:48pm] n2_sales_force: 007 gave me 2 other addresses that might be used to create contracts as well (other than 414)‚Ä¶ would those other 2 be used for rebalancing as well?
[1:49pm] mariarahel: nothing i would call rebalancing, no
[1:49pm] n2_sales_force: ok, i think i have a new heading now.. thank you very much for you time!
