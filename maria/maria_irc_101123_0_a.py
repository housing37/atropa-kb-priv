[9:06pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: I found it really interesting Maria chose Billie the Goat to send those tokens to. There is some Numerology in there that I'm sure is completely coincidental but interesting non-the-less.

[9:17pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: Using Ordinal Gematria, Richard Heart = 113, CiA = 13, Billie got sent the CIA token, and is a GOAT, Richard Heart was born in 1979, year of the GOAT. The KPOP Channel we got led to from the Tokenized Assets is called "1TheK". 1 = 1, The = 33, K = 11,(13311)....13 & 311 or 113.  Richard is the GOAT 💜 hahaha.

[06:30am] Guest2949: hey maria, do you expect the coins with 666 supply to ever reach parity all together? or is what we are seeing purely market conditions of people picking their favorite one.
[06:32am] pano joined the chat room.
[06:33am] paradise: Hey @mariarahel CIA and 2cc They are very similar in terms of supply, What can you tell us?
[06:38am] kpop: He remained silent about 2cc, but yesterday the pair with teddy was created and it has a good community I see, the big influencers have not yet entered it for that it has not been pumped, I took a little bit of it you never know

[08:32am] DadiWick: maybe somebody knows or sunny or Maria.. or anybody else..... With pdai, how do you ensure stability at 1 usd after that price would be reached if everyone then starts selling at 1 usd?
[08:33am] n2_sales_force: right now we can see some MEV arb going on to stop the price from both going up or down
[08:34am] _surfacing8671 joined the chat room.
[08:34am] _surfacing8671 left the chat room.
[08:34am] _surfacing8671_ joined the chat room.
[08:35am] _surfacing8671_: the same way you ensure stability that it will get to 1.
[08:36am] _surfacing8671_: unfortunately there is no bank that holds the collateral that enforces the dollar peg
[08:37am] _surfacing8671_: dai for example does in fact its called an over collateralized system. meaning it holds more then it needs to to make it 1 dollar
[08:38am] _surfacing8671_: lusd imo has a better chance at retaining peg because it has a pretty lucrative burning mechanic in place with the blusd and the chicken bonds. billions of lusd are being burned a day so far.
[08:39am] traeduct left the chat room. (Remote host closed the connection)
[08:41am] DadiWick: thanks guys.. but can you explain more... the big bags will be so big it won't be stable at 1 usd and perhaps many will sell there as a psychological level per Definition of a stable. or are we counting that liquidity will be so fat? the bags will be big also of all the early buyers.
[08:43am] Manga13: 2cc 👁️
[08:45am] _surfacing8671_: well its all psychological then isnt it. how does the usdc hold peg? someone gives circle 1 dollor in exchange for 1 usdc. meaning there is a 1 to 1 in the bank to make it equal to 1 dollar. so one thing that the pdai has going for it is that currently, i could be wrong here, but currently there is no way to mint the token. making it non-elastic. so it has a finite supply. the best way to hold the peg would be to give a way to burn the token as wel
[08:46am] _surfacing8671_: so like sell nfts for pdai and all of the pdai is burned
[08:46am] _surfacing8671_: the only way to hold the peg would be with a burning mechanic that we all need to create
[08:47am] _surfacing8671_: the best example would be to think of pdai now as an algorithmic stable coin. but with out the algorythim haha. so you need to create a market place so that whe  someone burns the token they also get something that they want in return. like actual trade
[08:49am] _surfacing8671_: its pretty simple economics dont think of the price dollar of the token look past that and think of what that token can buy. when something at the store goes onsale you go and buy it. when the price of pdai goes below peg that thing that cost 25 pdai gets a lot cheaper and what do you do? grab some pdai and buy that thing. thus pushing it closer to peg again
[08:50am] _surfacing8671_: that is the only way to retain and hold peg. no one just has a billion in the bank that will say yeah ill buy back in for you all to sell into
[08:52am] _surfacing8671_: i hope that makes sense. its a tough up hill battle that can be done. but takes a lot of work.
[08:53am] _surfacing8671_: also liquidity isnt your friend. the less there is the more slipage there is to get to peg and the more reked you get when trying to sell into it.
[08:53am] Tetragrammaton33: It doesn't need to make sense to everyone right now. yet. trust that Maria is smarter than anyone in this room and they have a plan
[08:54am] _surfacing8671_: forsure
[08:54am] Tetragrammaton33: you're also late to the party, we've been talking about this stuff for days already. check the log to learn more
[08:55am] _surfacing8671_: i have. been busy doing other things. friends have been filling me in
[08:55am] billie: I think a good liquidity supply can do this. I don't know if this is possible but we can do tokens to stabilise it. I am looking at pdai having 2 coins to hedge it. pdai up and pdai down. If liquidity is well distributed may e it can be set that pdai up buys when it falls bellow a dollar and pdai down sells wen it crosses a dollar to bring it back to 1.
[08:56am] _surfacing8671_: i have a paper that was written up a while back that explains a 9 token seystem that helps stabalize 3 diffrent tomb forks that is up that alley
[08:57am] Tetragrammaton33: if you scroll up to yesterday theres a link to telegram, where they stream a read only log of the chat, since the beginning. Should be very informative
[08:57am] _surfacing8671_: yeah im in it
[08:58am] _surfacing8671_: ill be back need some doughnuts nomnomonom

[11:32am] midnightmadwalk: I asked about views on kanye west because maybe the stem player design can serve as base of one of the mock ups for atropa application. Nvm if you dont like just share your views upon this.

[11:41am] teddybearpulse: Maria does your very last token 666 Conrad Ferdinand Meyer have some importance?
[11:41am] mariarahel: it's a reference to the basic alcohol-derived distillation products required to produce pharmaceutical cocaine
[11:41am] tetra33: I was actually curious about that as well. Obviously we’re very grateful to have access to you here, and I thought I’d ask if you would ever consider doing a live interview with somebody? Undoxxed of course, but just to have a live stream of questions and answers
[11:42am] mariarahel: i don't mind if that's arranged on irc
[11:43am] moose_: You can setup calls on the IRC platform?
[11:43am] mariarahel: i prefer to have everything in writing
[11:43am] tetragrammaton3: that would be great, thank you. we can work together to have some more concise questions to present you with

[11:56am] FREEDOM_Tokens777: I think Sound and Frequencies are tied into Blockchain and Money somehow, essentially another way of communicating or transferring energy. From Point A to B, Transmitters and Recievers, maybe symbolically  or metaphorically. ATROPA Ecosystem like an Orchestra and each instrument vibrates at different mHz and as the conductor moves their wand all the frequencies move toward a direction and produce a symphony.

[12:03pm] midnightmadwalk: @mariarahel: can you check above about gokuldham ?
[12:04pm] mariarahel: gokuldham is shot from the second oldest tv studio in the business
[12:06pm] Cryptic420: Goodnight gang
[12:06pm] Cryptic420: Love y'all
[12:06pm] Grav: peace.
[12:07pm] evelina_: What about empty character token? Could you tell something?
[12:08pm] mariarahel: the tv stories that everyone has come to accept as the factual basis of reality started in oaxaca, then gokuldham, then hengdian
[12:08pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: The OLDEST tv studio was built in the late 1800's and was called Black Maria which featured circus and vaudeville.
[12:08pm] LargeComfyChair joined the chat room.
[12:10pm] midnightmadwalk: Gokuldham society used in TMKOC is a SITCOM and i see F.R.I.E.N.D.S references in your playlist they connect somehow?

[12:11pm] LargeComfyChair: maria would be good if u added more 薙刀術ϟϟ with pair pls,atropa,teddy or something because community want push for LCC
[12:11pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: When you type in Chandler Bing on Google, his name has a Large Comfy Chair next to it lol
[12:12pm] Megury: lets give community for push LCC
[12:12pm] Megury: @mariarahel 👀
[12:13pm] Juice__: GM
[12:13pm] jack: LargeComfyChair: no expectations from the work of others. If you want something, you should build it yourself 😉
[12:14pm] LargeComfyChair: will do
[12:15pm] ead11: mariarahel: once I pointed out that friends and Seinfeld have a laughing soundtrack after every sentence hard to watch it 😅🤣
[12:17pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: LargeComfyChair: the Pulsechain Community should Add Liquidity to things they think are Valuable 🙏 if you have 2 different pairs that are pushing volume (414/PLS & 414/414) Then thays an Arbitrage Opportunity.
[12:18pm] jack: If we see a "smelly cat" token, that would be hilarious.
[12:21pm] newtwo_: Or Ski Cat
[12:23pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: And Liquidity is where my mind is Imagining. If you create enough Arbitrage Pairs and price differences and there is volume, can you replicate Wave Motion (Standing & Mechanical Waves) on Pulsechain and transfer lots of energy and make the Magic happen, or No?
[12:23pm] snowflake: 👀
[12:23pm] __Tbill joined the chat room.
[12:25pm] __Tbill: @mariarahel Were you backtesting some specific meme tokens you’ve launched cause when you go on dextool some pairs for the contracts are almost a year old!
[12:25pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: The theory of Wave Motion is also called Kymatology
[12:25pm] __Tbill: Also whats the purpose of that 666 token you just deployed?

[12:56pm] tetragrammaton3: 666 is to shake out the weak hand Crizchen whiners like Coach X 😂
[12:56pm] tetragrammaton3: he's obviously building in easter eggs in either direction, and said to maybe not buy a coin if you don't understand the name
[12:57pm] __Tbill: 333 666 999....(369=33) (33 influence) @mariarahel??????? not slick lol
[12:57pm] Grav: Buying 666 automagically sells your soul...  >:]
[12:58pm] tetragrammaton3: wow, same names as me! I'm waiting for either a Genesis P coin or some kind of Tetra coin. So i can claim ownership
[12:58pm] tetragrammaton3: lol grav
[12:59pm] LargeComfyChair left the chat room. (Remote host closed the connection)
[1:01pm] newtwo_: @mariarahel would you say this is accurate? As pDAI moves from 0.001 to $1, a lot of the extra circulating pDAI will need to be removed from pools, since far less is needed at a $1 price point.
[1:01pm] newtwo_: So the total pDAI balance in liquidity is expected to substantially decrease (e.g. 1000x decrease) as its price corrects from 0.001 to $1.
[1:01pm] Manga13: 2cc big moving, great opportunity

[1:12pm] n2_sales_force: @Freedom … i think you are right, @BigPP or @BigPoppy is definitelty RH
[1:12pm] n2_sales_force: …. 2023-10-09 15:58:56 Bigpp Hello everybody
[1:12pm] newtwo_: i dont think bigpoppy, but bigPP makes a lot of sense
[1:12pm] n2_sales_force: RH is opens up all is livestreams with ‘hello everybody'
[1:12pm] newtwo_: yep
[1:13pm] n2_sales_force: yeah maybe no poppy, but he’s only said one single thing so far, so i dunno
[1:13pm] Manga13: Guys, how can you guess something like that? Lol
[1:13pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: Epic hahahahaha
[1:13pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: Magic lol
[1:14pm] n2_sales_force: @manga … because i’m looking at the meta data for all the chats. you can decypher a lot by looking at timing and spefific patterns etc. thats how we cracked the minting puzzles (meta data)
[1:14pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: If you look in the Pulsechain Chat... first it was BigPP, then Sweden said that dumb comment, then it was Quite Contrairy, now it's Reeee (because RH got banned by Hbar lmao)
[1:14pm] n2_sales_force: can’t be certain of course, but i’m pretty positive lol
[1:17pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: Yea its  just fun guessing
[1:18pm] snowflake: @mariarahel is there any significance to the numbers on some tokens, bullion, smg, fpmb, japanese teddy?

[1:41pm] billie: newtwo_: I think it works like that but the main thing is about making it stable at 1$. Decreasing the supply sure boosts the price. Its easier for 3k CiA to hit a hundred than a million.
[1:43pm] Manga13: It is very easy for both 3K CIA and 4K 2CC
[1:45pm] snowflake: stop with the 2cc spam
[1:45pm] newtwo_: trying to shill 2cc with every breath haha...
[1:47pm] tetragrammaton3: yeah i think a ban is very close
[1:47pm] ead11: Top signal for 2cc everytime I jump into this chat someone is shilling it
[1:51pm] tetragrammaton3: *just Manga.
[1:51pm] Manga13: Guys don't be scared if there is a united community that talks about being holders, if you don't want to read that if you talk about it you can also get out of the chat you don't have to stay there, it's a discussion group
[1:52pm] newtwo_: just doesnt seem like the place to shill... there is social media for that, which would be much more beneficial to get your message out to new potential holders
[1:52pm] Grav: a discussion group watching over 100 coins.... I've seen 2cc in here 2 many times for a project with over 100 tokens.
[1:53pm] tetragrammaton3: @manga13 That's -not- what this group is for. There's plenty of telegram groups for that very thing
[1:54pm] Guest2548: This group is for talking with our cult leader
[1:54pm] Manga13: Okay guys you definitely haven't taken a bag yet, that's why you don't talk about it well
[1:55pm] Grav: lol
[1:55pm] Manga13: However, there is no problem, if it bothers I don't talk about it
[1:55pm] snowflake: @manga13 first you lie about 414 making LP pairs.. then you non stop shill. Go away
[1:55pm] Guest2548: Manga we're interested in pdai and atropa. Mainly pdai, take the side tokend and shove it bro

[1:56pm] Manga13: Possible breakout soon
[1:57pm] Manga13: They all know them
[2:00pm] newtwo_: i think we are all interestd in different tokens on the ecosystem, which is good, and is being noted which ones. Just trying to shill them here seems futile
[2:04pm] PulsePerza___ joined the chat room.
[2:04pm] Manga13: I don't seem to have told anyone to buy or try to convince someone lol it's a discussion group of the whole ecosystem if you talk about more than one token than another I don't complaining
[2:04pm] newtwo_: ok, now my messages seem futile. ill leave it at that, carry on...
[2:05pm] Guest2548: I want pdai to peg and atropa to help pdai do so along the way. I would like to learn about the ecosystem as a whole and pdai and atropa. I do not want to see someone trying to pump their CIA bag and 2CC bag in the only space that I have to learn from the developer of this inner ecosystem

[2:13pm] ead11: Could create a shill zone on irc  pretty sure dev would join so they could analyze different community efforts fruitful thought.

[2:58pm] GabrielMR_:  Focus focus ladies and gentlemen   back to business   how many Here have learned how to mint 414 tokens so far ?
[2:58pm] Grav: I missed out on so many good opportunities then.
[2:59pm] newtwo_: its interacting with the contract. i think anyone with the tools and knowledge to understand how to interact with them can mint the mintable tokens. there are two that i know of that are more or less of minting and more of a "bond issue"
[3:00pm] newtwo_: @mariarahel in regards to the "issue bond" mintable tokens... will they at some point be redeemable for the tokens needed to issue the bond?
[3:00pm] GabrielMR_: There is plenty of work and participation for us all to help out on minting 414 tokens.  This chat is for helping everyone participate with atropa eco system to help balance liquidity.   do you agree
[3:01pm] newtwo_: i believe maria mentioned the point of having mintable tokens and bonds was to scout for talent on the chain
[3:01pm] smileyday: yes, i have minted and issued bonds. Easy peasy.
[3:02pm] SwissAlpen: can you give a example of which is mintable
[3:03pm] newtwo_: someone tried minting FPMB and their key where stolen as they were not on a secure connection. seed phrase needs to be given in order to mint... so be careful
[3:06pm] Grav: Remember kids. Always use a new set of keys to play with.
[3:06pm] smileyday: no seed phrase is needed to issue the fpmb bond.
[3:08pm] newtwo_: hmm, im not sure what they did then
[3:08pm] smileyday: swiss- MV is mintable. You just press mint, and poof, you get MV. Fpmb is not a mint, its an issuance.
[3:09pm] smileyday: they most likely dont understand how to run scripts, and added the private keys to the code while using a public internet source.
[3:10pm] SunnyDay joined the chat room.
[3:10pm] Grav: Yea smiley, that's most likely.
[3:11pm] smileyday: Only one way to learn in crypto, gotta get burned...
[3:12pm] GabrielMR_: smileyday: it's. Ot the inky way ... but sure as he'll it happens in the volatile tech jungle too much. you get wiser as you go. But always something new and more advanced to work through and master
[3:13pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: That's your Crypto Education right there @smileyday 👍
[3:13pm] GabrielMR_: I hate my auto correct o. THe ohine  sorry my typing is so bad on my phone.

[3:15pm] Grav: Am I righ?
[3:16pm] SunnyDay: While it took a minute to figure it out, the bond was easy. I prob should have drained the pool, but instead i just gave away a few to those who helped me, and reinvested the rest into the ecosystem.

[3:19pm] newtwo_: i believe is also a bond
[3:20pm] GabrielMR_: Mariarahel: What is the purpose of a bond in the greater atropa eco system ?
[3:20pm] SunnyDay: I do like that the bonds are always available, and keep the game alive forever. I also appreciate the humor in them not having the liquidity to back them up. The bonds are what brought myself and two others together to work as a team. I could not have done it without them. They are friends for life now and i fully intend on meeting them both in the real world.
[3:20pm] Grav: new2 That's what's minted when one does the witchcraft I mentioned above.
[3:20pm] SunnyDay: There are 3 bonds.

[3:30pm] Grav: Some of us have been at it for a month, and haven't minted. Imagine those that are aware of Atropa, but not of the bonds.
[3:32pm] SunnyDay: house, do educate yourself on the difference between minting and issuing. if you are going to share info, proper info is best.
[3:33pm] _surfaing8671 joined the chat room.
[3:33pm] _surfaing8671: mooo
[3:33pm] PassportPowell: Sunnyday What is the difference? Does 1 increase supply and the other not? are there other differences?
[3:33pm] _surfaing8671: what is the difference?
[3:34pm] _surfaing8671: is one like a i add this and then get this and the other is ljust like a printer?
[3:34pm] SunnyDay: a mint increases the supply, and costs gas. An issue of a bond costs the total of the tokens to issue it. One is free, one is paid for.
[3:35pm] PassportPowell: ok you pay gas also for issuing too right?
[3:35pm] SunnyDay: of course, its a tx
[3:35pm] PassportPowell: So you can mint "out of no where" and you get issued based on what you put in?
[3:35pm] _surfaing8671: ok yeah that makes sense. some bonds you also pay in the other token thus burning the token you bonded with where as other places will hold that token as collateral to help regain the peg
[3:36pm] SunnyDay: yes, i can mint unlimited MV, but i dont have enough funds for unlimted fpmb lol
[3:36pm] PassportPowell: house_ did you mean "mint" for those tokens as in the total supply goes up or did you mean issue?
[3:36pm] _surfaing8671: i mean the cost in gas to mint mv would negate anything you get from it by my calcualtions lol
[3:37pm] SunnyDay: If the bonds are not redeemable, then the tokens used to issue it are essentially burned.
[3:38pm] _surfaing8671: the lusd mechanics are like that. but you can sell the blusd on the open market
[3:39pm] SunnyDay: MV is a non-stable, stable coin. Honestly i personally dont care to discuss MV specifically. And with withdraw myself from further comments on it here unless there is proper discussion around it.
[3:39pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: 👀
[3:40pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: 🤫
[3:40pm] _surfaing8671: what about discussion around ust? would that be in play?
[3:41pm] SunnyDay: tis an open forum...
[3:41pm] db_: why u deploy 666 maria?
[3:42pm] _surfaing8671: hail satan is why
[3:45pm] house_: @sunny sure, there’s a function in every one of those contracts. inside that function are
[3:45pm] house_: requirements to satisfy that involve checking your wallet.
[3:45pm] house_: part of the puzzle is trying to figure out those requirements (What you need in your wallet)
[3:45pm] house_: ... very creative i might add
[3:45pm] house_: if the requirements succeed,
[3:45pm] house_: then it emits the ‘Transfer(0x0, 0xUR_WALLET, amount)' event
[3:45pm] house_: this is what generates the tokens (from: 0x00, to:ur_wallet)
[3:45pm] house_: the tokens are 'issued/minted/whatever' from 0x00
[3:45pm] house_: they are not pre-initialized when the contract is created and then distrubeted later
[3:48pm] _surfaing8671: are you sure about that? i thought most were hard coded into it.
[3:48pm] house_: i’m not sure what you mean by hard coded exactly, but yet i am sure about the above
[3:48pm] house_: yes*
[3:49pm] SunnyDay: Issuing a bond is actually a bit more than just holding the tokens. Theres a proper way to do it, and only when done this way will it work. And yes that bond in minted into supply, but it is also burning from all the other supplies. Not much different from sending usdc to dai at 1-1, you burn one and mint the other.
[3:50pm] _surfaing8671: function SIGMA() public payable {      v0 = _SafeExp(10, uint8(18), uint256.max);    require(!0x1 | (v0 == v0), Panic(17)); // arithmetic overflow or underflow    require(0x7a20189b297343cf26d8548764b04891f37f3414, Error('ERC20: mint to the zero address'));    v1 = _SafeAdd(_totalSupply, v0);    _totalSupply = v1;    v2 = _SafeAdd(_balanceOf[address(0x7a20189b297343cf26d8548764b04891f37f3414)], v0);    _balanceOf[address(0x7a20
[3:51pm] house_: sorry i honestly have no idea about ‘issuing bonds’, or if those 2 words are referring to this address: 0x25d53961a27791B9D8b2d74FB3e937c8EAEadc38 … i just know that my code creates that address token from the 0x00 address
[3:51pm] _surfaing8671: looks pretty hard coded for this one. bonding would be different because it needs to check if you have the token to bond

[3:52pm] tetragrammaton3 left the chat room. (Remote host closed the connection)
[3:52pm] Grav: <3
[3:52pm] house_: so if you decode that hex value, it will tell you what requirement you are missing
[3:52pm] _surfaing8671: that just says that if it isnt the 414 address then itss an dead address and can only mint to the 414 address
[3:53pm] house_: ok then thats the wrong function sorry
[3:53pm] house_: but you ge the idea now
[3:53pm] house_: get*
[3:53pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: We getting in to some Big Brain stuff class, try and follow along.
[3:53pm] _surfaing8671: your good that is the mint function form the 0x174A0ad99c60c20D9B3D94c3095BC1fb9ddEFd62 token
[3:53pm] _surfaing8671: others are different.
[3:54pm] _surfaing8671: and anyone can call that function it just send it to 414 address
[3:54pm] SunnyDay: Its much simplier than that. I created a code that constantly check the price to buy all the requirements, and then prices what it can cash it out for. one click automation. Only used it once tho. Maybe i should have been more greedy for all of this lol
[3:54pm] house_: @_surf i’ll give you a hint, i’ve had one of the hidden mintable functions as my twitter account description for about a month now ; )
[3:55pm] _surfaing8671: yeah i have a whole list of them all somewhere. they all have code words to em to witch is cool

[3:56pm] house_: @billie very true
[3:56pm] house_: there’s a lot of shady stuff you can do with smart contracts
[3:56pm] house_: people don’t realize
[3:56pm] _surfaing8671: again that is not true tho. because the scanner shows who the creator is right on top
[3:57pm] _surfaing8671: the owner is on the contract but not who deployed it
[3:57pm] billie: True
[3:57pm] house_: its really all about just passing around variables and then hiding those variables inside arrays
[3:57pm] SunnyDay: twice in this conversation surf, you have spoke things i dont feel are true, but its because you are focused on dollar signs and not simple math. I say this for no other reason than to provoke thought in your head.
[3:58pm] _surfaing8671: oh i dont look at $ signs that not why im into to crypto. im in it for the freedom
[3:58pm] billie: house_: yea I have seen a sniper like that....turned out the dev put his address inside in tiny bits u won't see
[3:58pm] house_: exactl
