Oct 09 15:45:46 <hhyyll>	DTA73: if you can grab me some mcdonald
Oct 09 15:45:52 <Tbill>	That's the big question we agree on is it could easily go to a dollar but is there enough capital to collateralize the token is what people speculate on

Oct 09 19:52:09 <newtwo_>	@mariarahel Do you see implementation of price oracles in the future? This seems to be an important piece of the roadmap for stables. Can you comment on any information or knowledge you may have surrounding this topic?
Oct 09 19:52:48 <mariarahel>	i'm really not familiar with how that concept operations in solidity
Oct 09 19:53:24 <newtwo_>	@mariarahel Also, are there any plans for logos/icons for the tokens? Specifically, Atropa and some of the other more popular tokens. I feel it would increase interest in the ecosystem to have official icons.
Oct 09 19:53:53 <PassportPowell>	<mariarahel> When if pools open do you think any 414 tokens will be added to it on pulsex?
Oct 09 19:54:06 <mariarahel>	I have negotiations open with artists but no direction or coordination as of yet for the visual stuff

Oct 09 19:55:08 <Grav>	uff nice
Oct 09 19:55:19 <PassportPowell>	On your site twee you have a line at the top "Dysnomia Wrote THIS !" with hyperlink to Alchemist.txt. What is the significance of all the text in there? i've read some speculation from others
Oct 09 19:55:47 <newtwo_>	If ok, i might send some icon samples ive designed. I dont need any compensation for them. Ive already designed quite a few, while making my Atropa Eco map...lol
Oct 09 19:55:53 <hextrack>	As far as im aware oracles are basically just a contract of verified and trusted price feeds that it takes the average of
Oct 09 19:55:59 <mariarahel>	the Bullion5 is convertible directly in 1111111111:1 ratio for Bullion8 and will at some point in the future be purchased back and converted to Bullion8 permanently
Oct 09 19:56:11 <Grav>	new2 where can one see your map?
Oct 09 19:56:18 <newtwo_>	i havent released it
Oct 09 19:56:24 <newtwo_>	its unfinished
Oct 09 19:56:30 <Grav>	Where can I Beta test it?......
Oct 09 19:56:34 <Grav>	:]
Oct 09 19:56:38 <newtwo_>	too many tokens were dropped in a short amount of time haha
Oct 09 19:56:47 <mariarahel>	as long as it's hollywood quality i'll consider any graphics or mockups
Oct 09 19:56:49 <Grav>	Right here witcha'
Oct 09 19:57:02 <hextrack>	i'm working on building a map by liquidity thickness
Oct 09 19:57:16 <hextrack>	it should auto update as well
Oct 09 19:57:33 <Grav>	where can we see it hextrack?
Oct 09 19:57:48 <hextrack>	it's still in my private repo
Oct 09 19:58:08 <RedCandleChaser>	Ok so how is bullion5 going to be purchased back and converted into bullion8 could you hint at it? What about the holders?
Oct 09 19:58:17 <Grav>	Sharing is caring.
Oct 09 19:58:29 <mariarahel>	check the transaction log, it has been done already
Oct 09 19:58:45 <Megury>	@mariarahel: hello maria did this new tokens good for new investment?
Oct 09 19:58:56 <hextrack>	@grav im not done coding it yet lol
Oct 09 19:59:20 <sayyid>	any info about 666 supply last two weeks ?
Oct 09 19:59:28 <Grav>	Looking fwd. it, lot's of 'visual learners' out there asking for one.
Oct 09 19:59:38 <sayyid>	whats idea of 666 supply new tokens last week
Oct 09 19:59:48 <FREEDOM_Tokens777>	mariarahel: the visual aspect and logos/imagery is very important to people and people create meaning from it
Oct 09 20:00:01 <newtwo_>	the public definitely gets turned off by 666 supply. I figure this may be a type of warning to not buy that token?
Oct 09 20:00:30 <PassportPowell>	I thought that too
Oct 09 20:00:42 <hextrack>	i keep buying the 666 sup coins hahah

Oct 09 20:01:31 <PassportPowell>	lol
Oct 09 20:01:51 <moose_>	@mariahel once pDAI gets to $1 how do you expect it to stay there?
Oct 09 20:01:51 <newtwo_>	i got the hint from annabelle
Oct 09 20:02:02 <sayyid>	its just CODE tokens lp burned for 666 supply?
Oct 09 20:02:08 <mariarahel>	the 666 is to strike all the bad investing concepts away
Oct 09 20:02:33 <midnightmadwalk>	Hey

Oct 09 20:12:50 <newtwo_>	@mariarahel Can you elaborate on the choice of the name Atropa? Is it to represent the nightshade plant spieces? Or is it in reference to Atropos. Im leaning more towards Atropos, as the meaning would be very fitting. Or maybe it is something else? The reason I ask, is so I might have proper inspiration when designing potential artwork.

Oct 09 20:32:35 <moose_>	@mariarahel what do you mean when you say there are certain price floors that ATROPA can't go under. Does that remain true if PLS goes down past a certain level?
