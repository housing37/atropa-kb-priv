[2:17pm] jack: newtwo_: yup. Funny i remember once..I did a decent pump on leg day...was going upstair.. my legs couldn't support and I got sat back to previous step hilariously. Some people laughed but in that moment I felt that satisfaction.

[4:23pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: Hi Maria!!!
[4:23pm] Grav: man these 2cc holders sure are pushy....
[4:24pm] PassportPowell: lol
[4:24pm] ii711: it's a 2 cent club, they're desperate
[4:24pm] teddybearpulse: Im not a holder lol
[4:25pm] mariarahel: i think we will see 3c atropa by end of year

[4:25pm] ii711: good year

[4:29pm] SHVDXW9__ left the chat room. (Ping timeout: 480 seconds)
[4:29pm] moose_: Some people were concerned that there would not be enough collateral on-chain to back the 22B supply of pDAI to keep it pegged to $1. Do you know a way around this?
[4:30pm] teddybearpulse: @mariarahel: is there a token that is highly undervalued at the moment, in your opinion?
[4:30pm] Tetra414 joined the chat room.

[4:40pm] Tetragrammaton: Nice. I'd like to ask a lot more, but they're not on the level of understanding most people have of Luquidity Pool alchemy. So i'll prob stick with discussing avant garde & industrial music
[4:40pm] PassportPowell: lol just ask your questions. no onecares if you're smarter than them. WE're here to learn
[4:40pm] OCG: This chat reminds me of Satoshi Nakoamoto when he used to be in the BTC forum before Bitcoin blew up lol
[4:41pm] teddybearpulse: What makes you say that atropa could hit 3c by the end of the year? @mariarahel
[4:41pm] moose_: why did the 414 address create an LP pool with DOGE in May and burn the LP?
[4:41pm] moose_: referring to DOGE/ATROPA
[4:41pm] mariarahel: reached zero confidence in doge
[4:41pm] moose_: lol
[4:42pm] DTA73 joined the chat room.
[4:42pm] sp_:
[4:43pm] Tetragrammaton: it's apparent you are creating your own form of block chain science and tech before our very eyes. Would you say this tech is more related to the understanding of deep cryptography, or of pure finance and liquidity pool mechanics?
[4:43pm] Grav: How's your level of conficence for XEN? It was an early strong LP for Atropa.
[4:43pm] Kossman1111 left the chat room. (Remote host closed the connection)
[4:43pm] Kossman1111 joined the chat room.
[4:44pm] mariarahel: i think the lag on hedron has been bad for xen

[4:44pm] r17 joined the chat room.
[4:44pm] r17_ joined the chat room.
[4:45pm] mariarahel: we should expect it to take #1, that's why it was created

[4:45pm] Kossman1111 left the chat room. (Remote host closed the connection)
[4:45pm] Grav: i'm mmissing the connection between Hedron, and XEN expand please?
[4:45pm] Kossman1111 joined the chat room.
[4:45pm] Grav: #1 !
[4:45pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: Pulsechain- the most LIQUID Chain in Crypto
[4:46pm] Tetragrammaton: yeah i'll understand more as time goes on. I just wanna buy a Throbbing Gristle token. Nurse WW
[4:46pm] mariarahel: if we had seen a strong hedron launch we would see xen as an intermediary token trading heavily with it i think
[4:46pm] Tetragrammaton: *or NWW
[4:46pm] Kossman1111: How do you plan to stabilize a pdai peg without an oracle?    I don't see that as a possibility.
[4:46pm] Grav: AH I see.
[4:46pm] _Tbill: @mariarahel Are there any utility tokens in comparison to TSFI/Atropa that will accompany pDai you have yet to deploy?
[4:47pm] mariarahel: there is a second layer that will come later
[4:47pm] Mav_ left the chat room. (Remote host closed the connection)
[4:47pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: Nice...
[4:47pm] _Tbill: Genius per usual
[4:47pm] Kossman1111 left the chat room. (Remote host closed the connection)
[4:47pm] _surfacing8671: did you need help with communicating with rpc server without using POST? web3.js and ethers.js are 2 js libraries that wrap those for you. there are some others for python and rust as well.  but if you are looking for more in depth stuff then look at the docs for geth and what not.
[4:48pm] Koss joined the chat room.
[4:48pm] Koss: A second layer?
[4:48pm] _Tbill: @mariarahel Were you backtesting some specific meme tokens you‚Äôve launched cause when you go on dextool some pairs for the contracts are almost a year old!
[4:48pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: Is that second layer On-Chain already, or yet to be created ?
[4:48pm] moose_: I think we're all very curious to know how you believe pDAI will peg lol
[4:48pm] Manga13: https://kpop.fandom.com/wiki/U_(ONF)
[4:48pm] Tetragrammaton: Second layer oooo. The ultimate going being to both arrive at a common datapoint, without communicating it
[4:48pm] DTA73 left the chat room. (Quit: Igloo IRC: https://iglooirc.com)
[4:49pm] Manga13: this token was the first to be paired with 2CC on launch -> Ïú†
[4:49pm] Koss left the chat room. (Remote host closed the connection)
[4:49pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: üëÜ
[4:49pm] teddybearpulse: These second layer tokens will be a great chance for profits do you think? How can we recognize them?
[4:49pm] Kossman1111 joined the chat room.
[4:49pm] mariarahel: the dysnomia project will be connected after there are graphics in place to frame the operational scenarios
[4:49pm] Tetragrammaton: *the ultimate goal
[4:49pm] Manga13: they have segments dating back as far as 2020
[4:49pm] Manga13: k-pop connection being a program on KBS world radio station
[4:49pm] Kossman1111: You have stated not knowing about an oracle.  An oracle will help greatly.  Fetch is the oracle coming to pulsechain In days or weeks
[4:50pm] mariarahel: is there any python wallet that works with pulsechain ?
[4:50pm] Manga13: Y2C
[4:50pm] Tetragrammaton: ok gotcha. Thanks for identifying how dysnomia plays in, i was struck by that phrase when i heard it - and Atropa suddenly made a lot more sense
[4:50pm] Mav_ joined the chat room.
[4:51pm] _surfacing8671: you can make one using web3.py
[4:52pm] PassportPowell: "i think we will see 3c atropa by end of year" Nice so back to ath
[4:52pm] _Tbill: @mariarahel Were you backtesting some specific meme tokens you‚Äôve launched cause when you go on dextool some pairs for the contracts are almost a year old!
[4:52pm] Kossman1111 left the chat room. (Remote host closed the connection)
[4:52pm] teddybearpulse: When approximately do you think pdai will peg to 1 dollar?
[4:52pm] moose_: @mariarahel when you say expect to see 3c ATROPA do you mean that as a price floor?
[4:53pm] mariarahel: when i read that metamask uses infura for the rpc server, is that fact ?
[4:53pm] Kossman1111 joined the chat room.
[4:53pm] _surfacing8671: you can input any rpc u want
[4:54pm] Kossman1111: Mariah:  does this help?  figures, assumptions and calculations. It is extremely valuable for strengthening my critical thinking and analysis skills. I appreciate you taking the time to ensure I learn this properly.  Copy  Tell me again how the oracle will help atropa in maintaining a pdai peg.  K You're right, it's important that I re-explain how an oracle like Fetch could help Atropa maintain the pDAI peg in light of the less
[4:54pm] _surfacing8671: including localhost if  you are running your own node or are using a local for with hardhat and so on

[5:03pm] teddybearpulse: @mariarahel: what do you expect the price of pdai to be in 2 years from now?
[5:03pm] pulseperza: I belive Rackams pool dumped PLSX most recently. Could have been anyone in that pool. BUt i m unsure of the technical aspects of their pool
[5:05pm] Tetragrammaton joined the chat room.
[5:06pm] ii711: <@mariarahel> will most atropa tokens be used on layer 2?

[5:52pm] koss11[m] joined the chat room.
[5:53pm] newtwo_: It's a live feed. What are you talking about haha. OK, you get no more of my energy. Your logic is severely flawed.
[5:53pm] r_: is it going through a 3rd part? or no?
[5:53pm] r_: if yes, then it can of course be edited
[5:53pm] Tetragrammaton: drama gets blocked pretty quick in here, beware _r
[5:53pm] r_: you scammers never think deeply enough
[5:53pm] GabrielMR_: r_: I'm saying a TG channel for Atropa people developing for Atropa focused on Atropa participation.  I'm here in IRC chat too   I'm referring to any telegram channels where people are working together putting the technical clues together
[5:53pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: ok, ok boys play times over, put the tokens back in the box and get ready for nap time. Ol' Freedom getting some warm milk ready.
[5:53pm] Tetragrammaton: LOLOL
[5:54pm] newtwo_: All you have to do is go in there and see it's the same messages. It's live lol. What's your deal, calm down
[5:54pm] GabrielMR_: Remember we win by participating together to help atropa system do what it needs to support system
[5:54pm] newtwo_: OK I'm done
[5:54pm] r_: @freedom i apologize you are correct
[5:55pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: If you guys want to brawl, take it to Sunnys  Pub hahaha üíú Let's esteem this place high here Maria gave us all the blessing of being in the inner sanctum. Let's not ruin it hahaha.
[5:55pm] Grav: +
[5:55pm] newtwo_: Exactly
[5:55pm] r_: ‚Äúexactly‚Äù
[5:56pm] koss11[m]: Finally setup this IRC chat, sweet Jesus, reminds me of the ole BBS days.  heh
[5:56pm] GabrielMR_: FREEDOM_Tokens777:  I agree .  Mari does good job kicking people out
[5:56pm] newtwo_: Thankfully
[5:56pm] r_: Perfect
[5:58pm] koss11[m]: has anyone asked if Maria knows of Broots?  and if so, of his invitation to come on the channel?
[5:59pm] Tetragrammaton: Broots knows about it, and it's a bit too complicated for Ian
[6:00pm] r_: it would be cool to have a TG bot to relay messages/questions to this feed‚Ä¶ that would be real easy and safe for people‚Ä¶ maybe someone should get there ‚Äòdevs‚Äô on that
[6:00pm] DadiWick: koss11[m]: bbs?
[6:00pm] koss11[m]: not what I asked.  Does Maria know about it?
[6:01pm] Tetragrammaton: being very thankful for this resource to interact with Maria, i was planning to ask if they ever considered doing a live (undoxxed) interview in the future. the answer is likely NO, but id planned to ask
[6:01pm] newtwo_: Maria doesn't care for social media, she already said this IRC is enough, in regards to appearing on any type of social media
[6:01pm] koss11[m]: BBS:  Bulletin Board System..    you had to call other computers and connect through landline telephones.  pre internet by far
[6:02pm] PassportPowell: ALso "Ian" already  sent a message through maria github repo
[6:02pm] Tetragrammaton: i asked maria about BBS's earlier, and he said all of those questions should go to "GregOS"
[6:02pm] koss11[m]: BBS tells people your age
[6:02pm] Tetragrammaton: *GregOP
[6:02pm] koss11[m]: lol
[6:02pm] Tetragrammaton: exactly.
[6:03pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: Broots and Ian can come here and join in üëç
[6:03pm] Grav: There was a broots that joined yesterday, not saying it was him, just sayin'.
[6:03pm] koss11[m]: I got that NewTwo..  but Maria obviously uses Youtube, that is why I asked.
[6:04pm] koss11[m]: and Maria can watch the video.
[6:04pm] koss11[m]: https://www.youtube.com/live/3wzGLcmHfBI?si=FLNTFu_T8yTAaTm1
[6:04pm] r_: yeah and she watches friends too!
[6:04pm] koss11[m]: yup saw that
[6:04pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: Friends
[6:04pm] r_: FRIENDS
[6:06pm] Grav: oooorrrrr they used Friends to point to Mathews connection to iCE?
[6:06pm] Guest2548: @mariarahel: what does atropa mean?

[6:31pm] koss11[m]: Curious..  Many are asking when pegging 1.00.  (I do not think that is appropriate).
[6:31pm] koss11[m]: I asked Maria if they were going to use an Oracle.  Maria answered that they did not know about Oracles, which leads me to believe that Maria doesn't know about Fetch (Tellor Fork) coming online.  Concerning.
[6:31pm] koss11[m]: More appropriate to ask how rather than when.
