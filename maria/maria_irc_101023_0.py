[6:50pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: @mariarahel: between your entire ecosystem, have you ever looked into Wave Motion Theory on the Blockchain? And the idea of perpetual Arbitrage of different pools of the right tokens between Liquidity pairs, creating a resemblance of mechanical and standing waves like Oscillating Frequencies, it's the transferring of energy from one side to another.
[6:52pm] Grav:
[6:52pm] ii711: you can even call it a... pulse
[6:53pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: A... Heart Beat
[6:53pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: Or like a Symphony.
[6:57pm] Tetragrammaton: ??Love this question. Doubling down on hoping it gets answered
[7:00pm] Guest2755 left the chat room. (Remote host closed the connection)
[7:10pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: Expanding on my question. So for example, you would have a 414 Token/PLS Pair, and a 414/414 Pair, and a 414/PRC20 pair, and while Hearts Law comes into play, these pair groupings would always cause a Price difference which can be Arbitraged which leaves behind Fees in pools whether it's Bots or real traders, which helps build the forever floor on the network and makes access to tokens more easily available . Richard
[7:10pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: Heart wants pulsechain to be the most Liquid Network in Crypto. Richard Heart calls PLS a big Vampire attack on Ethereum. It's all about Liquidity

[08:02am] FREEDOM_Tokens777: What if MV token is not "dead" and it just has a functionality that isn't exactly clearly  defined by what you logically see on a proce chart. My thought is that MV continues to mint, but it also continues to have a burn ratio of 66%? So there has to be some kind of Mathematical Ratio between MV token price, the price of Gas on Pls, and the moving of Volume and Liquidity.
[08:03am] hextrack: There's no reason it couldnt be used to redeem as well

[08:16am] paradise: For anyone interested access the 2cc community channel: 2cc channel
[08:17am] FREEDOM_Tokens777: MV is a token that Mints infantely (still has a cost), it is mostly paired with Liquidity, and get used by 414 to move volume around. It has an expansive network of LP pools throughout the Atropa Ecosystem. It maintains a 66% burn ratio and should follow Hearts Law and will be interesting to see what it does when we have large uptick in time for Gas Prices.
[08:18am] FREEDOM_Tokens777: I dont understand how it's "dead"

[08:21am] paradise: Unfortunately yes mv many people have lost money

[08:24am] paradise: You fully agree, I'm an mv holders I still believe it

[12:25pm] pulseperza joined the chat room.
[12:27pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: Hi Maria !
[12:27pm] NukeLies: Hello Maria
[12:28pm] mariarahel: the idea all along has been to map out like a fluid constitution the set of concepts and definitions that makes the ecosystem a good investment, and currently whether a thus-mapped out set of such monetary-tied concepts can be considered 'production' quality at all
[12:30pm] sayyid: maria, can you added lp for this ËñôÂàÄË°ìœüœü i see yoh still holding 66.66% supply because lcc just paired with this, thanks
[12:32pm] PassportPowell joined the chat room.
[12:32pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: mariarahel: so was I going somewhere with the ideas I wrote earlier or am I way off? I'm really trying to educate myself more on several different scientific concepts and how they relate to the blockchain, and ultimately this ecosystem we are involved in alongside you/team .
[12:33pm] teddybearpulse: Hey @mariarahel, so the purpose of the atropa ecosystem is to steadily and slowly, using liquidities and bot transactions, pump up the ecosystem of the following tokens majorly: ATROPA, teddybear, tsfi, pdai? Or the final purpose is just to bring pdai to 1 dollar and peg it?
[12:33pm] sayyid: thankyou so much
[12:33pm] robin_: Hola Maria
[12:34pm] mariarahel: i'm interested in an investment production with momentum, I hope that the liquidity locking currently place the system moving forward not entirely in any individual control
[12:35pm] mariarahel: there are a number of situations that could occur as the network becomes more attractive
[12:35pm] Megury: 666 still growing
[12:35pm] midnightmadwalk: Hello
[12:36pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: Thanks Maria!!!
[12:36pm] midnightmadwalk: Is there something hidden in music ? Or its just meant to enjoy ?
[12:36pm] midnightmadwalk: I guess its just reference ü§∑
[12:36pm] mariarahel: the ownership on teddy bear has been most proactive and I could see it taking off first because of the profit to the large investors
[12:37pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: Nice!!
[12:37pm] Megury: Maria whats of definition of invesment of hegemony-ÿπÿ¨’© ?
[12:37pm] midnightmadwalk: 2021 playlist of 5 songs
[12:37pm] midnightmadwalk: I am talking about that @mariarahel
[12:38pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: @mariarahel: did you have an specific intention behind the transferring of CIA token to the Specific person you did? I'm very interested in this.
[12:38pm] Megury: sorry in typo , @mariarahel  whats is definition for invesment for hegemony-ÿπÿ¨’©
[12:39pm] mariarahel: the setups on the test tokens for the qingdao were taking from top holders of specific coins at the time of contract creation
[12:40pm] mariarahel: the trust model is intended to set that portion of the ecosystem up as having known pitfalls to failure as it becomes more valuable in the future
[12:40pm] pulseperza left the chat room. (Ping timeout: 480 seconds)
[12:40pm] doomreader joined the chat room.
[12:41pm] teddybearpulse: @mariarahel: is the final purpose of the entire atropa ecosystem to peg pdai to 1 dollar? And also bring up the value long term of the most supported tokens like teddybear and tsfi?
[12:41pm] aster joined the chat room.
[12:41pm] mariarahel: being top holders of any of the tokens with „âæ is likely to see more easter egg style activity in the future
[12:42pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: LOL yea im sure....NICE!!!
[12:42pm] pulseperza joined the chat room.
[12:42pm] mariarahel: the goal is to have a cushion vs crash as the stable tied assets in locked liquidity gain value that surpasses the investments
[12:42pm] sayyid: how about being top holder tokens with arabics ?
[12:42pm] aster: hello
[12:43pm] mariarahel: i am regularly auditing top holder positions on all the contracts to guage how the system is going to move forward and if any reward is warranted it will probably come into play
[12:44pm] sayyid: thanks!
[12:44pm] mariarahel: i fully expect there to be UAE partnership at some point in the future
[12:46pm] NukeLies: Maria could you say something about the Poppy token?
[12:46pm] mariarahel: it is a backing asset to the treasury in equal but different proportion to bullion
[12:47pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: mariarahel: I see your ecosystem like Pistons in an Engine. Like Hydraulics. Working together for a purpose.
[12:47pm] mariarahel: the treasury assets can all be expected to trend to stability over time, I expect them to more or less reach an inflation cap and then hold there
[12:47pm] robin_: Bullion 8 podr√≠a estar respaldado por oroü§î
[12:47pm] doomreader: Thanks for the great info, what is the SAND token for Maria?
[12:49pm] sayyid: ÿßŸÑÿßŸÖÿßÿ±ÿßÿ™ this uae right?

[12:50pm] midnightmadwalk: Token
[12:51pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: mariarahel: are you keeping track if Liquidity providers as well, or no ?
[12:52pm] mariarahel: there are no liquidity portions yet placed by 3rd party large enough to be considered to track
[12:52pm] Grav: lol our size is not size.
[12:52pm] robin_: Hola Maria podr√≠as decir al sobre Monat money
[12:52pm] PassportPowell: Trust me lmao
[12:53pm] PassportPowell: You lot aren't stackin LP enough for maria to notice haha
[12:54pm] midnightmadwalk: I am moving my momat wbtc lps to one wallet
[12:54pm] newtwo_: @mariarahel if someone say had an VERY large position in pDAI and or Atropa and was able to swap liquidity into other assets. what LP would be considered the most valuable and beneficial for them to provide? Beneficial to the Atropa/Stable ecosystem... In your opinion
[12:54pm] JJ76 joined the chat room.
[12:54pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: mariarahel: yea its hard our here for a pleb, doing our best üòÜüôè
[12:55pm] paradise: @mariarahel: Are there any good prospects for the 2cc?
[12:57pm] Namely joined the chat room.
[12:58pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: PassportPowell: someone has to start it off and do it too. Eventually it will be there and large enough to be "noticed" and whether it's noticed or not Liquidity is very important to any blockchain and ecosystem.
[12:58pm] mariarahel: i think i am interested in exploring what 'production quality lp pairs' would mean
[12:58pm] newtwo_: I think we all know who has a ridiculous amount of pDAI. I think theyd be willing to LP, if given some guidance
[12:58pm] Mav_ joined the chat room.
[12:59pm] juice_: RH
[12:59pm] newtwo_: no, this person has more
[12:59pm] juice_: oh
[12:59pm] juice_: nineiron
[12:59pm] mariarahel: in terms of mechanism, if 100% of an asset is placed on LP & that LP transferred so as to be locked, and then the asset is purchased back, it makes that LP asset "production quality", but the threshhold is less severe than that
[1:00pm] newtwo_: definitely, well i dont think he is willing to lock it up... but good to know
[1:00pm] mariarahel: for the assets that we expect to see meteoric rise in as the asset moves to be $1 stable, I do think it makes sense for 3rd party to introduce locked liquidity pairs to a futureproof asset
[1:01pm] newtwo_: right
[1:01pm] newtwo_: is the Atropa token designed to be a stable token?
[1:02pm] PulsePerza__ joined the chat room.
[1:03pm] mariarahel: consider this 3rd party risk scenario, imagining you have for ex $1billion in PDai, you create your own asset, lock 50% of your new asset with 50% of your pdai and burn that LP, imo you have created at that point a production-quality asset that could be considered for pairing with the atropa ecosystem
[1:03pm] JJ76 left the chat room. (Ping timeout: 480 seconds)
[1:03pm] mariarahel: how exactly it gets paired has a lot of options depending on the philosophy of what you are doing
[1:04pm] moose_: you say $1 stable, but once it gets there I'm very curious on what mechanism you believe will keep it stable at $1 if you are comfortable answering that question.
[1:04pm] newtwo_: interesting
[1:06pm] midnightmadwalk: @moose_: dont know exactly but may be " with the initial aim of helping to bring stablecoins closer to their pegs by incentivizing participants to sell above-peg stablecoins and purchase below-peg ones. "
[1:06pm] jack: mariarahel: prodution quality asset sounds like a sacrifice for future
[1:06pm] midnightmadwalk: Address.sol have pickle finance address and when we search about pickle finance we see how it works as above text
[1:07pm] mariarahel: if you look at how dOWN & ATROPA are paired, the massive locked liquidity in ATROPA is significantly less than the originator contract holdings for the token, even as the stables track to $1 but every investment into dOWN introduces a greater ratio for the contract originator to eventually cash out
[1:07pm] PulsePerza__ left the chat room.
[1:08pm] PulsePerza__ joined the chat room.
[1:08pm] Grav: So there's huge future incentive to create 'production quality' assets; copy.
[1:09pm] moose_: what about the #2 token? I noticed it has similar LP/MC to ATROPA when we first found it. It has a 1M mc and 1M Liquidity. Is it a similar token to ATROPA?
[1:09pm] mariarahel: the LEGAL token incentivies the purchase into dOWN because it allows access to production quality assets like „â£ that will always have greater liquidity than asset value
[1:10pm] jack: Mention of dOWN makes me wonder is there any connection with non-414 token named uP ?
[1:10pm] jack: uP token is primarily based on buy&burn mechanism and that is supposed to be achieved by a benevolent wallet
[1:10pm] mariarahel: there is a potential to pave the way there to things like FDIC insurance, etc
[1:10pm] newtwo_: so, in clarity, The locked ATROPA helps stabilize the price to an extent, but the unequal ratio between locked liquidity and developer-owned supply for dOWN itself may be a concern for investors?
[1:11pm] Grav: FDiC.... whoa.
[1:11pm] mariarahel: the holding position on dOWN is intended to justify itself over time & is currently at a significant loss from the invested capital
[1:11pm] newtwo_: i understand
[1:13pm] mariarahel: i think of ATROPA & dOWN like the originator checking & savings account with the savings expected to see the interest over time
[1:13pm] mariarahel: not through minting but through purchase of the asset only
[1:15pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: Thank you for a deeper dive under the hood of your ecosystem when it comes to Liquidity.
[1:15pm] newtwo_: so basically, your initial investment into deploying dOWN, is underwater at the moment and we may see a recoup in the future.
[1:15pm] mariarahel: i expect to see my own profit come primarilly out of there during the initial stages
[1:15pm] moose_: in your eyes, why do you think TsFi is the best investment for short-term porfits?
[1:16pm] mariarahel: TSFi will see the buy/sell pressure exhausted first in my opinion
[1:16pm] juice_: So we aren't even in the initial stages yet?
[1:16pm] mariarahel: it's close.. i can't pronounce it stage one production yet though
[1:17pm] juice_: got it
[1:17pm] newtwo_: i believe we are in construction stage

[1:21pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: I like the 666 tokens !
[1:21pm] newtwo_: monat money... so youre saying aggressive bot buying large number of supply is creating artificial demand and inflates the price?
[1:21pm] mariarahel: the monat money token was released explicitly to be distributed to the buy robots that were active in the system at the time, the crash last week targetted and was caused by the same robots
[1:22pm] Grav: Dasting!
[1:22pm] Megury: hmm 666 token meta üëÄ
[1:22pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: Epic
[1:22pm] mariarahel: so far I like what they're doing, I intend to continue structuring the assets to support their work
[1:22pm] SunnyDay: Hi everyone. Just a quick hello, and thank you to @mariarahel for creating such a beautiful piece of work. Your vision and knowledge have taught myself and others so much. You have changed more lives than you can ever imagine, or will ever know. <3
[1:22pm] juice_: Why does the 0xFa token symbol also appear on Teddy, Treasury Bill, Monat Money and some others. What's the correlation?

[1:24pm] iTz_Black007 left the chat room.
[1:24pm] juice_: So 0xFa is a core part of the investment platform and will play a key role as the ecosystem grows?
[1:24pm] mariarahel: i hope everybody feels we are at a 'so far so good' stage so far
[1:24pm] juice_: I definitely do
[1:24pm] newtwo_: I think we are at an amzingly perfect start
[1:25pm] Megury: yeah thanks rahel
[1:25pm] PassportPowell: Yep yep
[1:25pm] mariarahel: the Ojeon contract is intended to satisfy the definition of "Legal Tender"
[1:25pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: Everything running smoothly
[1:25pm] paradise: I'm happy to see the 2cc/teddybear pair thanks Maria, lp pair quality, now I understand what you meant by that message before
[1:26pm] SunnyDay: I just got back from 6 days off. Maria broke my head. I dont have any questions at the moment. Just heard about and wanted to find the chat and share some appreciation.
[1:27pm] jack: Legal tender in real world can be minted out of thin air..so we expect same from Ojeon ?
[1:27pm] hdrnscum: Sunny glad to see you brother we miss you in the pub. Hope all is well and we see you around soon. Much love mariarahel this level of information was never available to us before we are all greatful!
[1:28pm] SwissAlpen1 joined the chat room.
[1:28pm] mariarahel: the Ojeon is drawn from the mintable Treasury Bill which is drawn on the Teddy Bear
[1:29pm] SwissAlpen1: hello Maria hope you are have a good day.
[1:29pm] moose_: From this steady/observation phase would you say that everything is running as smoothly as you'd hope it would?
[1:30pm] newtwo_:  "so far so good"
[1:30pm] SwissAlpen2 joined the chat room.
[1:30pm] juice_: ^
[1:30pm] mariarahel: i feel like it is an operational success thusfar, I hope that as more people become more familiar with the platform that I can see where the bar for "production" is and then meet that
[1:31pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: In Chinese numerology, the number is considered to be lucky and is often displayed in shop windows and neon signs. In China, 666 can mean "everything goes smoothly"
[1:31pm] Megury: =3 flying dude
[1:31pm] ironclad: when you launch a new token would you like to see us add to the initial LP pair you created or create a WPLS pair?
[1:32pm] SwissAlpen2: maria do you do this in your spare time, do you have assistance? It must consume a huge amount of your time.
[1:32pm] jack: When you say drawn, are there any financial constraints that are maintained to say how much can be drawn for how much? Basel norms state something around 10-15% of assets held for capital adequacy ratio. If I go by that definition, would it make sense for me to say treasury bill is highly undervalued compared to what it should be because of teddy bear?
[1:33pm] Tradcut joined the chat room.
[1:33pm] mariarahel: i would agree with that statement, jack.  as the only fully mintable asset in the entire system it presents some of the more regular trust dilemmas that come with crypto
[1:33pm] Megury: maria is there new deploy today?
[1:34pm] mariarahel: there is nothing additional currently in sight
[1:34pm] SwissAlpen2: I think we need to see further highs to draw people in from outside the chain, we had huge influx with Pdai and teddy. that mixed with some confidence from RH would onboard the influencers and OG's
[1:34pm] juice_: So would it also make sense to say that 0xFa is undervalued compared to Treasury Bill
[1:34pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: Woah
[1:35pm] mariarahel: There are zero use-cases in place yet for the Ojeon so its presence is merely academic.  if/when unique client development gets going it will literally be the legal tender token of the first client-oriented system
[1:36pm] juice_: Awesome
[1:36pm] r_: Perfect
[1:37pm] r_: @passport lol

[1:39pm] iTz_Black007: like prices feed of atropa eco system as general?
[1:39pm] iTz_Black007: or something else in mind of yours
[1:39pm] mariarahel: it could go a few different ways but the first version will likely involve only the scan api
[1:40pm] iTz_Black007: like show all the tokens shown in addresses.sol
[1:40pm] moose_: is the Legal token just a way to lock LP? Why is it's main token pairing with Teddy Bear?
[1:40pm] mariarahel: if anyone has http get/post content for submitting arbitrary token transactions with wallet data I can add api for that
[1:40pm] newtwo_: is there a reason Ojeon biggest LP is wbtc?
[1:41pm] iTz_Black007: also why there is no ci/cd for this one to build and sign an app to test
[1:41pm] Man joined the chat room.
[1:41pm] mariarahel: the liquidities on the LEGAL token define it as a unique custodial asset

[1:46pm] SunnyDay: @mariarahel, Was any of this like a chess game for you? Or where you just following the plan you had in your head. I feel like there where times you were trying to stop some of us from doing certain things, and show us how to do better things. In particular When i added $12k to dimension liquidity and started to exit my position (late august) you almost immiditaly made MV (or WM as its on your contracts) and then dumped into my pls
[1:46pm] SunnyDay: And then you pumped a ridiculous amount into dimensions. Be it intentional or not you taught me a lot in those moves. And showed me what MV/WM was.
[1:47pm] mariarahel: the tokens with thai names should be considered in-play, i will be competing with holders of those coins to maintain certain positions
[1:47pm] iTz_Black007: oh thats easy ah...

[2:06pm] mariarahel: several aspects on the ecosystem were designed to have built-in exploitation in order to get talent involved
[2:06pm] mariarahel: the FPMB token is the primary one
[2:06pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: Sure, everyone is a little weird, but if you take the time to talk to people and listen to them, you can gain understanding and see where people are coming from and what they're all about.
[2:06pm] mariarahel: so far
[2:06pm] SwissAlpen2: sorry to change topic but the 666 amount token james knox polk, I saw you mention the image and, you said he was responsible for the Cherokee language - but this was sequoyah, he died from a reparatory infection

[2:07pm] SwissAlpen2 was kicked from the chat room by mariarahel. (gtfo)
[2:07pm] tetra33: Hah, no Maria I didn‚Äôt. But I might be the only one who understands and shares musical tastes. Perhaps some of the non-finance related interests as well, judging from your book list on twee.se
