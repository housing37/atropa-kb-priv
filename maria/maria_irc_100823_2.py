[10:01pm] PassportPowell: OK so if HEX has a slow trickle up then pDAI will also have a small trickle up?
[10:01pm] mariarahel: i'm not really in a position to predict
[10:01pm] PassportPowell: How does the performance of PLS affect the pdai
[10:01pm] PassportPowell: ok that's fair
[10:02pm] rm3: When designing the ecosystem did u have a timeframe in mind when pDAI can hit $0.01, $0.10 and $1?
[10:02pm] moose_: Maria, was the LP buying up DAI and getting sent to the 0xDead address encoded into the ATROPA contract by you?
[10:02pm] rm3: Not gonna like everyone would love to hear ur predictions on WHEN
[10:02pm] rm3: lie*

[10:04pm] miney: Maria, will there ne a bog reveal on 11 octobre?
[10:04pm] Ferrari joined the chat room.
[10:05pm] PassportPowell: If i understood correctly you are interested in a client-concept that allows anybody to easily buy in at like a $5-$20 level and then immediately be able to view depth about their investment options and swap around easily. Is this potentially the pulsechain wallet the RH was reffering to a while ago on one of his lives
[10:06pm] PassportPowell: Could you potentially be trying to create the/a wallet
[10:06pm] mariarahel: i think a lot of people have thought about how to prototype such a thing and there is no good option yet
[10:07pm] mariarahel: i meet people that would love to jump in but the process is not straightforward
[10:07pm] mariarahel: 1. people don't want to use coinbase
[10:07pm] pdizzle3: Maria do you have any interest, involvement or plans involving  the pickle token on pulsechain?
[10:07pm] mariarahel: 2. people don't have any conception of bridging assets
[10:08pm] mariarahel: etc
[10:09pm] PassportPowell: Ok so safe to say you haven't started on a wallet if you were hypothetically to attempt to create one
[10:09pm] PassportPowell: perfect
[10:09pm] PassportPowell: That's fair. What are your thoughts on Twitter/x potentially creating a wallet. Do you think people would prefer to use something like that over Coinbase?
[10:09pm] mariarahel: i have only looked at read-only calls to the scan api thoroughly so far
[10:09pm] Ferrari left the chat room. (Quit: Page closed)
[10:09pm] mariarahel: and those are slow

[10:11pm] Grav: maria what inspires you to do so much? RH is in it for glory. You?
[10:12pm] Guest2661: ^
[10:12pm] mariarahel: i think we can win BRICs
[10:12pm] PassportPowell: Ok earlier/last night you  mentioned about your expectation that "richard wraps up the SEC stuff and it goes in his favor" what makes you bullish about that position?
[10:13pm] rm3: By wrapping up the SEC stuff u mean the settlement / deal will be the best option for pulsechain?
[10:13pm] mariarahel: rh hasn't scammed so there's no reason for the sec judgement to really prove overly harsh but it will clarify a number of regulations and afterwards his plan will be bound to move forward
[10:13pm] PassportPowell: Perfect
[10:14pm] Simple: RH created the DreidelContract confirmed
[10:14pm] PassportPowell: You speculate that RH case specifically will be the one to bring clarity to a certain number of regulations over some of the other tokens and founders that are also being targetted by the sec
[10:15pm] Simple: if anyone can win this case itâ€™s RH
[10:15pm] PassportPowell: Can you clarify what you mean by winning BRICs? is that the new china and russian currency
[10:15pm] rm3: yeah, in 2 years lol
[10:16pm] mariarahel: it depends on what the contexts of the ruling end up actually being.  if it is a clarification of the responsibilities of high-frequency traders with trades covering SEC oversighted areas then it's just a basic broad tax issue affecting all of crypto
[10:16pm] shvdxw9_ joined the chat room.
[10:17pm] mariarahel: they aren't in a position to single out rh but just to use him as an example where they have something way out of control
[10:17pm] PassportPowell: Is it a part of your expectations that RH will settle (assuming that would also be in his favour vs a fine/worse)?
[10:17pm] mariarahel: i'm sure it's a tax issue
[10:18pm] PassportPowell: I could see that
[10:18pm] mariarahel: i have paid taxes on every single trade since i created the wallet, i believe that is far out of the ordinary
[10:18pm] rm3: they like to kick the can down the road, when it comes to a losing cases
[10:18pm] PassportPowell: Ok so make an example then back to business for RH
[10:18pm] PassportPowell: Created the wallet?
[10:18pm] PassportPowell: oh the 414 my mistake. i got ahead of myself
[10:19pm] mariarahel: you have to consider cost basis even on the first eth deposit, yes
[10:19pm] PassportPowell: Ok I do want to ask about that but i want to be tactful haha.
[10:19pm] PassportPowell: I'll just ask. How did you make all your money?
[10:20pm] PassportPowell: we were watching the 414 wallet the other weel and saw it kepy jumping up in total $
[10:20pm] newtwo_: its because debank
[10:20pm] PassportPowell: ahhh something to do with the way it shows balances?
[10:21pm] newtwo_: takes a while to register
[10:21pm] rm3: paper gains, did u see the tokens?
[10:21pm] newtwo_: yeah, some tokens dont reflect a dollar amount
[10:21pm] newtwo_: sometimes when you LP it will show
[10:21pm] PassportPowell: It was a while ago but i think i remember seeing the totals going from 100k to over 1m at one point
[10:21pm] mariarahel: the reason the asset becomes a security is because the facilities that stabilize and maintain its price exceeds the threshhold for sane tax-reportable things that are set up so as to skip reporting
[10:23pm] PassportPowell: ok let's switch up a little unless anyone else has questions or you want to comment on anything specific
[10:23pm] PassportPowell: How/when did you get into coding ND CRYPTO
[10:23pm] PassportPowell: and crypto*
[10:24pm] PassportPowell: You have a lot of knowledge, it's very intriguing
[10:25pm] Tetragrammaton414: Is your background mostly in coding, or in mathematics?
[10:25pm] Tetragrammaton414: Or finance?
[10:25pm] Guest2661: ^
[10:25pm] newtwo_: I was wondering about the next phase mentioned, in observing and stabelizing. what does that entail? is there functions in place to make that happen? or is it more of a sitback and observe?
[10:26pm] rm3: Are u a guy or a gal? Lol
[10:26pm] jack: Hi @mariarahel , good morning. I finally have you online. I got 1 question, You have kept bill burr token separately in the addresses list in GitHub. I also see 1 of the person pretty much holding 85% of the supply including LPs for that. Is there something peculiar about that contract to list separately?
[10:26pm] newtwo_: also, is there any Ai involved with any of the tokens
[10:26pm] Ra: Keeping track of taxes in crypto is very difficult. Since pulsechain is relatively new, it seems third party services (koinly etc.) cannot yet process most of the transactions. Are people doing 1000s of transaction calculations manually?
[10:26pm] mariarahel: I plan on getting those portions of the Bill Burr token that I still hold to him at some point
[10:26pm] liquid_resonance joined the chat room.
[10:27pm] mariarahel: as long as he stays alive
[10:27pm] pdizzle3: lol
[10:27pm] newtwo_: thats awesome haha
[10:27pm] PassportPowell: Bill burr is a G
[10:27pm] jack: Haha ..nice
[10:27pm] mariarahel: ya we gotta keep him
[10:27pm] newtwo_: Also, do you have any position or connection with Anthropic, that you can speak of?
[10:27pm] PassportPowell: SENS foundation should test longevity on him
[10:28pm] jack: Yup that sounds great but is there anything peculiar about that contract that you listed it separately?
[10:29pm] Tetragrammaton414: So no questions about background then. Speaking of the last big pump with the 414 coins - Do you feel like it went just as expected, or did it go up too quick, and thus dumped quickly also? Do you speculate much on the pumps/dumps and why they happen, and when?
[10:29pm] PassportPowell: Yeah i noticed that, I was going to move on lol
[10:31pm] jack: I see reference of atropa in your dating way back. How long have you been working on atropa or you intended to create something like this?
[10:32pm] midnightmadwalk: Hello
[10:32pm] moose_: You mentioned that the bots were what caused the crash last week but what has to be put in place to cause a pump externally from buy pressure from humans

[10:34pm] Tbill left the chat room. (Remote host closed the connection)
[10:37pm] PassportPowell: we see some tokens out there that are referencing the sens foundation (none created by 414) but are these any relation to 414 or RH?
[10:42pm] hardrive joined the chat room.
[10:44pm] PassportPowell: On your site twee you have a line at the top "Dysnomia Wrote THIS !" with hyperlink to Alchemist.txt. What is the significance of all the text in there?
[10:44pm] newtwo_: I think maybe Maria afk for a bit
[10:45pm] PassportPowell: Yeah. Refreshment break everyone
[10:45pm] Grav: There's no bartender. Sadg-
[10:45pm] Tetragrammaton414: I think it's safe to say Maria IS the alchemist. Solve Et Coagula
[10:46pm] pdizzle3: @mariarahel yesterday you mentioned "teddy bear and a handful of other coins are meant to act as meme coins" could you elaborate on which coins are part of the "handful"
[10:46pm] newtwo_: i inputed the entire script of dysnomia into claude... it took me like 20 minutes lol
[10:46pm] PassportPowell: yeah my internet kept crashing lol
[10:46pm] PassportPowell: browser*
[10:47pm] Hironimus: I feel like you guys are talking with RH lol
[10:48pm] Tetragrammaton414: people need to drop that narrative. This person is nothing like RH, other than they're both smart. 100%
[10:48pm] newtwo_: claude says this about dysnomia...
[10:48pm] newtwo_: https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/LjVQj7xK/
