Oct 08 01:24:06 <FREEDOM>	Thank you 414 much love and blessing from Freedom Tokens 777 üôè
Oct 08 01:24:16 <Megury>	oke
Oct 08 01:25:04 <vivian>	Sunny created 414 after applying all he learned from tracking your activity across the blockchain
Oct 08 01:25:20 <newtwo_>	he launched a1a before atropa
Oct 08 01:25:28 <vivian>	Did he?
Oct 08 01:25:33 <mariarahel>	the locked liquidity set is designed to provide a token of a capital strategy that is ostensibly better then meme or even stable coins by retaining a fault-bottom-specific floor for buyers
Oct 08 01:25:40 <ead11>	It's a pleasure to endure this journey having fun each step of the way

Oct 08 01:28:16 <hexican>	I'm worried about what happens after the 'soaring salt price' bubble bursts!
Oct 08 01:28:29 <mariarahel>	the network of coin liquidities that extend from that token are intended to cover a private/public distribution strategy that honors either myself, long term buyers, or early buyers

Oct 08 01:29:16 <newtwo_>	so there are certain tokens we should not be swapping into?
Oct 08 01:29:39 <mariarahel>	i have a plan to develop a non-browser based client interface that i'm interested in getting some involvement with
Oct 08 01:30:12 <mariarahel>	hoping somebody knows rpc calls, i think rhmax alluded to also wanting this info
Oct 08 01:30:18 <newtwo_>	Are you in contact with Richard Heart about any of this?
Oct 08 01:30:34 <mariarahel>	i bet richard will show up
Oct 08 01:30:38 <newtwo_>	yep
Oct 08 01:31:41 <PassportPowell>	Are you in direct contact with RH?
Oct 08 01:32:07 <mariarahel>	if he shows up to #pulsechain we will see him
Oct 08 01:32:08 <PassportPowell>	Also there's some doubt that you are the Atropa dev. would you mind creating a token for us?
Oct 08 01:32:23 <newtwo_>	i think he already said was gonna sell IRC
Oct 08 01:32:27 <newtwo_>	and did
Oct 08 01:32:33 <PassportPowell>	ahhh I missed that
Oct 08 01:32:41 <mariarahel>	i can make irc.debian.org#atropa also with the IRC symbol but it seems redundant

Oct 08 01:33:12 <newtwo_>	are you JEOIII?
Oct 08 01:33:17 <PassportPowell>	I see your point. If newtwo_ has said you've already proved then it's okay
Oct 08 01:33:34 <alexander_as_helios>	i would not bs you gents
Oct 08 01:33:57 <newtwo_>	disregard

Oct 08 01:37:38 <udin>	New token to celebrate?
Oct 08 01:37:49 <newtwo_>	wait wait...so youre saying Atropa will essentially guarantee a minimum price level or floor for buyers by controlling liquid token supply even if demand falls?

Oct 08 01:42:40 <Scape>	This is very exciting haha, what made you reach out to us finally?
Oct 08 01:42:48 <newtwo_>	This is probably the greatest story ever told in crypto history
Oct 08 01:43:08 <hexican>	Is it possible that pdai will peg at 1$? and how is it gonna stay there, assuming people are going to sell it like crazy
Oct 08 01:43:50 *	teyasio has quit ()
Oct 08 01:44:06 <Simple>	not many in here will hold it to a dollar, and it‚Äôs not going to a dollar In one straight line.
Oct 08 01:44:14 <house_>	‚Äúwithout json post ?‚Äù ‚Ä¶ so you want to try to use a GET request?
Oct 08 01:44:20 <FREEDOM>	Maria I have a question do you have any relation to the person who is behind KYMATO or is it you/team?
Oct 08 01:44:28 <house_>	with data as query params?
Oct 08 01:45:23 <hexican>	Of course it's not going in a straight line, I`m just curious about the process and what will hold it there
Oct 08 01:46:25 <PassportPowell>	What made you decide to create this group to reveal that information now?

Oct 08 01:47:15 <Scape>	This is nice I gotta say
Oct 08 01:47:23 <PassportPowell>	Understood
Oct 08 01:47:27 <Grav>	How large is your 'pla' maria? How many more tokens?... or is it as many as it takes?
Oct 08 01:47:27 <mariarahel>	if someone wants to create a faq and handle newcomers going out it would be rad :) :)
Oct 08 01:47:32 <Grav>	plan*
Oct 08 01:47:37 <FREEDOM>	Thank you for inviting us!
Oct 08 01:47:38 <axe>	Do you think pDAI pegs before this year and is what starts the bullrun for pulse chain?
Oct 08 01:47:59 <PassportPowell>	How the journey to selling 1 IRC going? i see you're at 0.7
Oct 08 01:49:03 <mariarahel>	the tokens thusfar represent the best of my capacity to define a legal tender complex financial instrument that satisfies all the requirements of the plays on money including the fears associated with the absolute worst case scenarios
Oct 08 01:49:05 <rm3>	Did it all go as u expected so far?
Oct 08 01:49:42 <mariarahel>	people keep buying in so price go up and liquidity go back down
Oct 08 01:50:16 <PassportPowell>	Based on what you've learned so far if you could go back and start again what would you do differently?
Oct 08 01:51:01 <mariarahel>	it's moving ahead pretty well on so far so good.. the outlook is pretty fantastic and certain parts of the system have already and are meant to go completely out of my control
Oct 08 01:51:27 <Scape>	would these parts of the system be the contracts with burned lp?
Oct 08 01:51:45 <house_>	can you release any info about the finance team behind this?
Oct 08 01:51:52 <mariarahel>	the crash last week was related to liquidity going up with fixed and specific ratios which caused the bots to scrape profit and pull out
Oct 08 01:52:25 <mariarahel>	i hope it set the factual bottom for the tokens so far made available
Oct 08 01:52:51 <mariarahel>	it will literally be hard to drop further than what we just saw, ever

Oct 08 01:53:54 <MichaelT>	hellow world
Oct 08 01:53:55 <newtwo_>	theres a bunch of ppl that cant get in this chat, wanting to verify that your 414... they are hounding me right now... can you send .414 PLS to dead address?
Oct 08 01:53:56 <axe>	what are those bots? pulse chain bots?
Oct 08 01:54:20 <mariarahel>	i dunno who runs the bots that snap up tokens as soon as they are created
Oct 08 01:54:37 <SHVDXW9>	@mariarahel may i dm you or speak in the #trsi chat please
Oct 08 01:54:37 <mariarahel>	it might be dark magick hidden by the wizard richard
Oct 08 01:54:38 <axe>	So those bots could be anyone?
Oct 08 01:54:42 <MichaelT>	lets just say one of the bots is carbon based ;)
Oct 08 01:54:43 <axe>	Ah maybe so
Oct 08 01:54:51 <PassportPowell>	Sorry there's still some doubt about you controlling 414 wallet can you send 0.414 PLS of token to the dead address
Oct 08 01:55:00 <mariarahel>	i don't think i know you, shvdxw9
Oct 08 01:55:19 <axe>	So the liquidity went up with fixed and specific ratios. You're referring to the liquidity of pDAI specifically?
Oct 08 01:55:44 <mariarahel>	the strength of the network relies on the strength of the stable coins
Oct 08 01:55:50 <SHVDXW9>	i am 24dfa
Oct 08 01:56:19 <rm3>	People ask if you see any time frame for pDAI pegging to $1?
Oct 08 01:56:19 <mariarahel>	if the pulsestable coins are tethered to moving assets they're bound to go up
Oct 08 01:56:30 <axe>	So do you think that unless pulse chain has its own native stable coin it cannot succeed as some have said?
Oct 08 01:56:55 <mariarahel>	if those assets are liquidity locked then it gets harder and harder for the pulsestable coins to go down anyway
Oct 08 01:57:14 <mariarahel>	it's solid theory and the contracts are in place now
Oct 08 01:57:16 <Grav>	maria what drove you to develop on Pulse?
Oct 08 01:57:35 <ead11>	rm3:  it just depends on trading volume really  as Maria has stated above a handful of tokens are operating alone already
Oct 08 01:58:21 <ead11>	Pulsechain also has a burn on lp remove/add which creates a floor forever with plsxburn
Oct 08 01:58:41 <FREEDOM>	I can try and write something for people to join when I'm done with my business meeting. I'm using IRC cloud on my phone was really easy just need to input correct info.
Oct 08 01:59:26 <newtwo_>	maria, can you send .414 PLS to burn address, so all these other people that cant get in here can believe whats happening right now? that would be amazing
Oct 08 01:59:33 <mariarahel>	i suggest checking the ownership/renouncement, liquidity positions, and top holders on each token. The profitable easter egg is the minting of the FPMB tokens, and the recommended buy, in my opinion, is the TSFi token
Oct 08 01:59:46 <MichaelT>	or .414 PLS to A1A, lol
Oct 08 02:00:06 *	Wentworth (~wentworth@2600:8800:1723:1b00:9d6b:2f82:626:732a) has joined
Oct 08 02:00:21 <newtwo_>	what about minting the other token that requires 7 upsidedown R tokens and a handful of others to issue?
Oct 08 02:00:35 <mariarahel>	the TSFi liquidities probably won't be extended without discussion in this channel
Oct 08 02:00:41 <udin>	Can tou sent .414 pls to dead address or deploy somthing related in here again to proof someone outside that you are the one of 414 ? So will attract more people
Oct 08 02:00:50 <mariarahel>	i'll make up rules to keep the gambit going as we go
Oct 08 02:00:54 <newtwo_>	also is the upside down R token with the korean H next to it supposed to be RH?

Oct 08 02:04:25 <mariarahel>	the Teddy Bear token has been largely bought and will hit a liquidity bubble bottom after a little while
Oct 08 02:04:33 <axe>	I'm now back into Kpop haha.
Oct 08 02:04:49 <SwissAlpen>	what have I missed?
Oct 08 02:04:50 <mariarahel>	you can watch the kpop channel on samsungtv
Oct 08 02:04:55 <mariarahel>	https://www.samsungtvplus.com/
Oct 08 02:05:17 <PassportPowell>	What was goal behind creating theTEDDY BEAR token? some people believe it's to replicate the gains that SHIBA INU did on ETH
Oct 08 02:05:22 <axe>	I like Chungha, I think she's talented...but she's solo now.
Oct 08 02:05:40 <mariarahel>	The Teddy Bear is the deposit trust that backs the Treasury Bill
Oct 08 02:05:44 <newtwo_>	maria, can you please verify that you are 414 by sending .414 PLS to burn address. there are literally thousands of people who cant get in the chat looking for verification
Oct 08 02:06:05 <axe>	TVXQ got me into Kpop years ago.
Oct 08 02:06:05 <mariarahel>	newtwo, this is covered by the #pulsechain faq
Oct 08 02:07:03 <SwissAlpen>	are you happy for the community to push Teddy/ other tokens? Its hard to know what path to follow.
Oct 08 02:07:36 <axe>	Would you say the top tokens are Atropa/pDAI/Tsfi/Teddy bear? as many claim. Or is that incorrect?
Oct 08 02:07:51 <mariarahel>	you should make your decisions based on the factors of each token, like I said, I'm pretty sure we saw the eternal bottom already
Oct 08 02:08:08 <axe>	Feels like it for sure.
Oct 08 02:08:35 <mariarahel>	so it's good timing for all of them, but depending on how investment comes in, wild things could happen
Oct 08 02:08:49 <newtwo_>	im not really sure what you mean by the pulsechain faq... im not sure why it would be hard to verify you are 414
Oct 08 02:08:49 <PassportPowell>	What are your personal 5 favourite tokens you've created? and your 5 most disappointing tokens you've created?
Oct 08 02:08:50 <hexican>	What does the youtube video that you posted in "topic" represent?
Oct 08 02:09:27 <mariarahel>	the playlist should cover background on the language in the tokens
Oct 08 02:09:42 <axe>	awesome.
Oct 08 02:09:49 <SwissAlpen>	ok, is the ultimate end game, pDai to peg or just volume across the chain? what's your motivation?
Oct 08 02:09:58 <mariarahel>	play gambit with the kpop channel on samsungtv
Oct 08 02:10:27 <mariarahel>	it's supposed to be korean enough that they have to play
Oct 08 02:12:43 <newtwo_>	can you just send 1 pls to any address? Id really like everyone to stop asking me to ask you
Oct 08 02:12:46 <rm3>	Do u think you could join telegram or twitter spaces to talk about Atropa?
Oct 08 02:13:00 <mariarahel>	i think irc is enough
Oct 08 02:13:21 <newtwo_>	this is amazing, im so grateful to be here
Oct 08 02:16:15 <MichaelT>	@maria , what can we do as individuals / community to help the ecosystem most effectively?
Oct 08 02:17:43 *	hexican has quit ()
Oct 08 02:18:07 <mariarahel>	keep a faq !

Oct 08 02:18:35 <axe>	I saw the transaction. Awesome mariarahel
Oct 08 02:19:35 <Simple>	Maria what are some of the mechanics for the MORPH token and what significance does it play in the eco system?
Oct 08 02:20:03 <mariarahel>	Vomit Simple
Oct 08 02:20:44 <Simple>	meaning it‚Äôs garbage?
Oct 08 02:20:55 <mariarahel>	I wouldn't buy it
Oct 08 02:20:59 <Simple>	ok
Oct 08 02:21:42 <newtwo_>	What was your intention for the Atropa token when you launched it on Tomochain?
Oct 08 02:22:01 <mariarahel>	market was too unstable and I was only working with 100k

Oct 08 02:22:45 <mariarahel>	i don't think Tomochain feels like they have succeeded
Oct 08 02:22:46 <ii71>	are most of these tokens "vomit"?
Oct 08 02:23:01 <mariarahel>	no the morph token's name translates to vomit
Oct 08 02:23:01 <newtwo_>	did you get my texts? lol
Oct 08 02:23:03 <PassportPowell>	IS there any token you created that went above your expectations and any token that really dissapointed you?
Oct 08 02:23:06 <ii71>	especially with obscured names
Oct 08 02:23:19 <Scape>	I liked the Hexagrams, ‰∑•‰∑ù‰∑è‰∑ë‰∑Ω‰∑∏, but some dick called Scape Goat keeps shilling them badly
Oct 08 02:23:31 <mariarahel>	that's bad
Oct 08 02:25:26 <PassportPowell>	Earlier why did you say "i bet richard will show up"
Oct 08 02:25:26 <FREEDOM>	People got really creative with Monat Money and CIA.
Oct 08 02:25:50 <PassportPowell>	Is it because you have some info that makes you believe that
Oct 08 02:26:25 <mariarahel>	he should show up eventually at some point it goes without saying
Oct 08 02:27:08 <PassportPowell>	Ok I wasn't sure if you had info or were speculating based on the topic
Oct 08 02:28:39 <newtwo_>	CiA is referring to the ascii art group, correct?
Oct 08 02:28:53 <newtwo_>	Creators of intense art...
Oct 08 02:29:24 <newtwo_>	where you in any of those groups? iCE, CiA, Blade ?
Oct 08 02:29:50 <mariarahel>	i dunno what Blade is
Oct 08 02:30:11 <mariarahel>	and i was a little kid

Oct 08 02:34:04 <mariarahel>	it feels complete right now
Oct 08 02:34:23 <Wentworth>	are you in observation mode?
Oct 08 02:34:37 <Grav>	We really appreciated the Pirates With Attitudes.
Oct 08 02:35:23 <mariarahel>	as a gambit, it is winning
Oct 08 02:35:29 <DGGPKN>	Or is the observer the observed.
Oct 08 02:35:53 <Scape>	Were you the main one in charge of naming? I'm still making my way through the playlist, but it seems like a lot of thought must have gone into them
Oct 08 02:35:59 <Scape>	or were you trolling us haha
Oct 08 02:36:00 <udin>	Have you heard ethtc?
Oct 08 02:36:10 <Simple>	what significance does qingdao have, does it tie into a role of a possible internal cash currency?
Oct 08 02:36:31 <mariarahel>	you should get to know what the name of each token means if you like them
Oct 08 02:37:53 <Grav>	What is the extension of your use of scripts, many believed there was a 'bot' behind the 414 address.
Oct 08 02:37:54 <ii71>	will you drop hints? Like what 11th president has to do with anything?
Oct 08 02:38:09 <mariarahel>	have you seen the photo ii71 >

Oct 08 02:39:37 <mariarahel>	the photograph and the appearance of that body were in no way in the wishes of the living person
Oct 08 02:39:54 <Simple>	Does this have a connection to the CherokeeContract
Oct 08 02:40:03 <udin>	You are connected with ead11 ?
Oct 08 02:40:12 <mariarahel>	that's his father's alphabet work

Oct 08 16:46:39 *	Spaced is now known as BigPoppy
Oct 08 16:47:32 <TreasuryBill_OnX>	makes those renounced tokens very boolish and over the majority of tokens you deploy per month you can only read about 20% of them making them the chosen moonshots imo

Oct 08 18:08:19 <Tetragrammaton666>	Did everyone get their confirmation that Maria is truly 414? I have every bit of confidence, other than seeing them react on chain.
Oct 08 18:09:06 <Suave>	the easiest for him to proof would be to send 414 PLS to PLSX
Oct 08 18:14:18 <jack>	He has already verified himself. I hope people ask good questions when Maria is online.

Oct 08 18:14:31 <Tetragrammaton666>	Yeah, but they're also getting bombarded in here along with trying to do their own thing. With all of the other proof they're probably not concerned with proving to you that last 1%
Oct 08 18:14:51 <Tetragrammaton666>	I feel like they've verified themselves too. We'll see more verification as time goes on
Oct 08 18:15:02 <PassportPowell>	Yeah i asked maria to sell  1 IRC and they eventually did and said when they had done it

Oct 08 18:15:21 <PassportPowell>	Some people think it's coincidental and that they were watching and waiting for 1 IRC sell
Oct 08 18:15:39 <Tetragrammaton666>	Too much coincidence. It's them
Oct 08 18:15:40 <PassportPowell>	Either way this is fun
Oct 08 18:15:42 <moose_>	what a treat
Oct 08 18:15:42 <newtwo_>	proof... busytoby adds url to come chat in readme on github... hours later 414 releases token called IRC with same url... maria shows up in IRC.. idk what more proof you need
Oct 08 18:16:02 <PassportPowell>	Make sense to me. I'm 85% convinced
Oct 08 18:16:05 <Tetragrammaton666>	thanks newtwo. my thoughts exactly
Oct 08 18:16:38 <newtwo_>	why would 414 release token with chat and then some random comes and hijacks the chat.. makes no sense
Oct 08 18:16:50 <Tetragrammaton666>	they're prob just annoyed at people asking now. They have plenty more important things to do than to convince the last couple of skeptics
Oct 08 18:16:56 <newtwo_>	sorry, forgot to show up in my own chat i invited everyone to
Oct 08 18:17:52 <PassportPowell>	There is a rentry with some info "faq"
Oct 08 18:17:55 <Tetragrammaton666>	It sucks you have to keep IRC open the whole time to get the back log of chat entries. Gonna have to set my comp to not ever sleep so i can catch maria today
Oct 08 18:18:08 <PassportPowell>	https://rentry.co/atropa-eco-faq
Oct 08 18:18:17 <Tetragrammaton666>	sick, thanks powell.

Oct 08 18:18:25 <PassportPowell>	But you're welcome
Oct 08 18:18:38 <Tetragrammaton666>	for sending the link
Oct 08 18:18:41 <moose_>	This is what NineIron said in chat last night and I agree completely. "414 posted a link that that IRC chat via a new token. Why would it do that and link to a forum that wasn‚Äôt associated and risk messing it all up?"
Oct 08 18:19:19 <newtwo_>	@maria did you burn Atropa down to 069? are there any plans to burn more of Atropa supply?
Oct 08 18:19:33 <Tetragrammaton666>	I'm trying to onboard a good friend. He's an ETH og, and used IRC and BBS's a lot back in the day. He's gonna love this shit, once i actually get all of the information down succinctly to present to him
Oct 08 18:19:53 <PassportPowell>	Even worse if their chat was going to be front ran and hijacked they could have made a new token saying scratch that or an updated link they controlled.
Oct 08 18:20:11 <PassportPowell>	nothing like that happened so I have high confidence in this being the atropa dev

Oct 08 18:24:22 <Tetragrammaton666>	telegram/twitter is too easy. the underground aspect of IRC means only the real ones will be here. or mostly

Oct 08 19:55:19 <moose_>	i have so many questions lol
Oct 08 19:55:56 <mariarahel>	main question i see was asked re: renouncing tokens, this is to allow any superficial scan to verify that there aren't any latent mint functions callable by contract owner
Oct 08 19:55:57 <FREEDOM_Tokens777>	Tetragrammaton666: everyone got a dang riddle lol!! Forsure hahaha thanks üëç
Oct 08 19:56:48 <FREEDOM_Tokens777>	I think that is one of the most asked questions people have on telegram and Twitter is about Token minting.
Oct 08 19:56:58 <_grav>	maria there are 200 videos in the „â£ „â≠  Å playlist, does this mean there will be 200 tokens?

Oct 08 19:59:02 <Simple>	Maria do you see an inbound recovery coming for the WritingContract since it‚Äôs 90% dip? Since the violent dip in certain coins could be viewed as mainly over, will we see recoveries? or will there be new tokens taking over the tiles of the older ones?

Oct 08 20:00:17 <Simple>	your success points are measured in gradual stability of the overall system?
Oct 08 20:00:39 <JJ76>	Maria, does kymato play a role in atropa ecosystem and if so what role does kymato play in the atropa system?
Oct 08 20:00:43 <mariarahel>	the next stage is stability and steady growth
Oct 08 20:00:43 <newtwo_>	quick question. was it you that reduced Atropa supply to 069? Is there plans in the future to burn more Atropa supply?
Oct 08 20:00:53 <mariarahel>	i don't know what kymato is
Oct 08 20:01:29 <moose_>	Maria by steady growth are you referring to a similar climb to the period between August 1st - August 17th?
Oct 08 20:01:32 <mariarahel>	the 1mil burn on atropa was meant to set an early bar for the amount of holdings I expected in top holders
Oct 08 20:01:54 <mariarahel>	there are a bunch over 1mil currently but I expect that number will drop as the value goes up
Oct 08 20:02:00 <newtwo_>	I am refereing to the 42 Atropa that was burned about a week ago
Oct 08 20:02:10 <FREEDOM_Tokens777>	mariarahel: I talked to Kymato Dev yesterday they reached out to me from this chat, they're trying to support pDAI along with you üëç
Oct 08 20:02:17 <newtwo_>	the supply is now 1,111,111,069

Oct 08 20:04:22 <ccc>	where is the summary? is that the one on rentry.co?
Oct 08 20:04:31 <mariarahel>	TSFi is the asset I personally recommend because it's most likely to return the largest profit on the smallest short term investment
Oct 08 20:04:43 <Tetragrammaton>	Maria - Was that you doing the Current 93 cover on soundcloud? Found it while researching last week. lol

Oct 08 20:05:03 <mariarahel>	the Teddy Bear is possibly stronger for a large investment but I presume anyone putting that much into the system can do their own research
Oct 08 20:05:45 <midnightmadwalk>	do you recognize me ? we exchanged emails
Oct 08 20:05:51 <newtwo_>	Maria, when you created a few different tokens, you sent 1 to kymato token, 1 to Jedi Master, and 1 to pickle... what is the significance?
Oct 08 20:05:56 <PassportPowell>	HI Mariarahel Do you have any plans for RH birthday? in terms of anything on the blockchain?
Oct 08 20:06:02 <Tetragrammaton>	Powell are you cataloging all of these chats, or is that just the one from last night?

Oct 08 20:07:58 <mariarahel>	the lp holdings on renounced tokens is purely symbolic, rather than sending the locked liquidities to 0xdead it translates into a more meaningful way to represent why the liquidities are locked and what the tockens and their utilities are supposed to represent

Oct 08 20:13:47 <newtwo_>	What is the purpose of the MV token? is it to continuously generate volume? It seems kind of like a penny tray...need a penny, take a penny...
Oct 08 20:13:49 <Suave>	@mariarahel Is your plan to bring pDAI to 1 USD?

Oct 08 20:15:45 <mariarahel>	the handful of openly mintable tokens are intended to help burn pls and test an experiment for tokens of lowest value

Oct 08 20:17:58 <mariarahel>	but if the tokens required to issue 1 FPMB cost less than the bond is worth, then it should encourage issuance

Oct 08 20:21:38 <mariarahel>	i don't play games or make bets :)
Oct 08 20:21:48 <JJ76>	Boom!
Oct 08 20:22:04 <Suave>	Maria What's your plan with pdai?
Oct 08 20:22:07 <JJ76>	Awesome. I quit that as well thanks to RH and his advice
Oct 08 20:22:12 <SHVDXW9>	gm
Oct 08 20:22:17 <BigPoppy>	Do you believe having Teddy Bear bridged to ETH will be beneficial long term. Would it help to have more liquidity in it?
Oct 08 20:22:27 <juice_>	Maria, when you say steady growth, would you compare this to the period of August 1st - August 17th
Oct 08 20:22:30 <Simple>	yeah but there‚Äôs are gigantic fear about the mint ability of tokens, and therefor people are too scared to push tokens in the eco system
Oct 08 20:22:31 <JBSmooth>	Maria, Thanks for your hard work! In your opinion do you feel that the atropa ecosystem will be one of the main catalyst for this upcoming bullrun and may likely lead the way?
Oct 08 20:22:35 <midnightmadwalk>	I shared FPMB experience in your inbox maybe if you have little time check it out @mariarahel
Oct 08 20:23:01 <mariarahel>	i think we are making a case for the best investment in crypto
Oct 08 20:23:11 <ii71>	lfg..
Oct 08 20:23:13 <Tetragrammaton>	It's amazing to see someone who is equally a fan of crypto development, finance, Magick, kpop, and the Swans. truly fascinating
Oct 08 20:23:23 <_grav>	wow.
Oct 08 20:23:24 <mariarahel>	if that proves true then we'll see improved asset inflow
Oct 08 20:23:29 <Guest2631>	Should I name my first born Atropa or pDai?
Oct 08 20:23:40 <FREEDOM_Tokens777>	YES!!!
Oct 08 20:23:41 <FREEDOM_Tokens777>	Lfggg
Oct 08 20:23:42 <Suave>	Which of the 100s token is the best investment lol
Oct 08 20:23:46 <midnightmadwalk>	What is dysnomia?
Oct 08 20:24:00 <_grav>	maria where does the name Atropa come from to you?
Oct 08 20:24:04 <newtwo_>	Can you specify any plans for front end applications you may be working on? Wallet, Portfolio, Dex etc...?
Oct 08 20:24:06 <moose_>	Maria should I sell my house for more pDAI?
Oct 08 20:24:21 <Simple>	capital could be flowing in if there would be more clarifications for normal people about mintable coins. investors are hesitant
Oct 08 20:24:30 <mariarahel>	dysnomia is a math proof, if all goes well it will be integrated as a sidechain that stores hook contracts on pulsechain for off-chain peer to peer interactions
Oct 08 20:24:44 <PassportPowell>	jheeeze
Oct 08 20:24:51 <mariarahel>	i'm not clear on what the utilities will be yet
Oct 08 20:24:55 <SwissAlpen1>	Atropa if a girl Pdai for a boy?
Oct 08 20:25:01 <Devi_>	Hi Maria, I see you have tied liquidity to pWBTC. I feel it‚Äôs greatly undervalued at the moment. Do you have furthers plans for pWBTc?
Oct 08 20:25:16 <mariarahel>	i would like to see CAW finished

Oct 08 20:26:45 <FREEDOM_Tokens777>	Big mystery token
Oct 08 20:26:45 <mariarahel>	we don't have any good UX examples for blockchain based functions outside of pure profit making
Oct 08 20:27:02 <JJ76>	It's decentralized Twitter . From what I've been told

Oct 08 20:28:43 <midnightmadwalk>	Why you are rewarding pickle ?

Oct 08 20:31:28 <mariarahel>	that's designed to set up the whole outlook, the profit potential for jumping into a token with a lot of locked liquidities of other tokens likely to go up in value and a very low number of holders at all is literally most likely to return the best profit on a random buy

Oct 08 20:34:35 <mariarahel>	the ethereum liquidities will come later
Oct 08 20:35:14 <mariarahel>	as I understand, the 3 pulseStable assets are controlled by 3 distinct entities with the DAI & USDC teams being more closely linked together and the USDT team being more tied to bitcoin
Oct 08 20:35:46 <Guest2631>	Will we have a merry Christmas i

Oct 08 20:35:57 <juice_>	How will the system work to hold dai at a dollar once it gets there

Oct 08 21:01:08 <jack>	mariarahel: Bullion 5 was paired to bullion 8 few weeks ago...and apparantly there was 1 way minting transaction. But since you removed the pairing from that pair and somehow bullion 5 hasn't dumped...and from all the tokens which are all dumped, bullion 5 has interestingly pumped. What is your take on this? Why that has happened? Is it only because of people taking interest in bullion 5 or something else? As per minting transaction,
Oct 08 21:01:08 <jack>	it seems bullion 8 is currently undervalued by 10x.

Oct 08 21:23:01 <FREEDOM_Tokens777>	The last bullrun was alot of fun even tho it was a hard and challenging time in life during the Plandemic. But this bullrun gonna be EPIC af, we get to ride it all the way together with 414, Rh, and all the early Pulsechain believers (us) and we get to witness the entire story unfold.

Oct 08 21:25:02 <ead11>	ItaloDisco:  we had a sporadic amount of tokens launched when more eyes drew onto atropa as dev has stated  there will only be a handful more of launches as there is enough tokens acting as financial instruments needed for a robust ecosystem

Oct 09 02:57:56 <mariarahel>	it depends on how the hex recovery actually happens, if the price tracks up strongly with an equal increase in pdai then we could see equal or better performance

Is this potentially the pulsechain wallet the RH was reffering to a while ago on one of his lives

Oct 09 03:06:24 <mariarahel>	i think a lot of people have thought about how to prototype such a thing and there is no good option yet
Oct 09 03:07:20 <mariarahel>	i meet people that would love to jump in but the process is not straightforward
Oct 09 03:07:36 <mariarahel>	1. people don't want to use coinbase
Oct 09 03:07:57 <pdizzle3>	Maria do you have any interest, involvement or plans involving  the pickle token on pulsechain?
Oct 09 03:07:58 <mariarahel>	2. people don't have any conception of bridging assets
Oct 09 03:08:45 <mariarahel>	etc
Oct 09 03:08:59 <PassportPowell>	Ok so safe to say you haven't started on a wallet if you were hypothetically to attempt to create one
Oct 09 03:09:00 <PassportPowell>	perfect
Oct 09 03:09:01 <PassportPowell>	That's fair. What are your thoughts on Twitter/x potentially creating a wallet. Do you think people would prefer to use something like that over Coinbase?
Oct 09 03:09:25 <mariarahel>	i have only looked at read-only calls to the scan api thoroughly so far

Oct 09 03:11:33 <Grav>	maria what inspires you to do so much? RH is in it for glory. You?
Oct 09 03:12:07 <mariarahel>	i think we can win BRICs
Oct 09 03:12:08 <Guest2661>	^
Oct 09 03:12:09 <PassportPowell>	Ok earlier/last night you  mentioned about your expectation that "richard wraps up the SEC stuff and it goes in his favor" what makes you bullish about that position?
Oct 09 03:13:25 <rm3>	By wrapping up the SEC stuff u mean the settlement / deal will be the best option for pulsechain?
Oct 09 03:13:28 <mariarahel>	rh hasn't scammed so there's no reason for the sec judgement to really prove overly harsh but it will clarify a number of regulations and afterwards his plan will be bound to move forward
Oct 09 03:13:48 <PassportPowell>	Perfect
Oct 09 03:14:22 <Simple>	RH created the DreidelContract confirmed
Oct 09 03:14:34 <PassportPowell>	You speculate that RH case specifically will be the one to bring clarity to a certain number of regulations over some of the other tokens and founders that are also being targetted by the sec
Oct 09 03:15:05 <Simple>	if anyone can win this case it‚Äôs RH
Oct 09 03:15:14 <PassportPowell>	Can you clarify what you mean by winning BRICs? is that the new china and russian currency
Oct 09 03:15:17 <rm3>	yeah, in 2 years lol
Oct 09 03:16:14 <mariarahel>	it depends on what the contexts of the ruling end up actually being.  if it is a clarification of the responsibilities of high-frequency traders with trades covering SEC oversighted areas then it's just a basic broad tax issue affecting all of crypto

Oct 09 03:17:12 <mariarahel>	they aren't in a position to single out rh but just to use him as an example where they have something way out of control
Oct 09 03:17:32 <PassportPowell>	Is it a part of your expectations that RH will settle (assuming that would also be in his favour vs a fine/worse)?
Oct 09 03:17:52 <mariarahel>	i'm sure it's a tax issue
Oct 09 03:18:11 <PassportPowell>	I could see that
Oct 09 03:18:21 <mariarahel>	i have paid taxes on every single trade since i created the wallet, i believe that is far out of the ordinary
Oct 09 03:18:24 <rm3>	they like to kick the can down the road, when it comes to a losing cases
Oct 09 03:18:31 <PassportPowell>	Ok so make an example then back to business for RH
Oct 09 03:18:49 <PassportPowell>	Created the wallet?
Oct 09 03:18:56 <PassportPowell>	oh the 414 my mistake. i got ahead of myself
Oct 09 03:19:09 <mariarahel>	you have to consider cost basis even on the first eth deposit, yes
Oct 09 03:19:39 <PassportPowell>	Ok I do want to ask about that but i want to be tactful haha.
Oct 09 03:19:52 <PassportPowell>	I'll just ask. How did you make all your money?
Oct 09 03:20:27 <PassportPowell>	we were watching the 414 wallet the other weel and saw it kepy jumping up in total $
Oct 09 03:20:42 <newtwo_>	its because debank
Oct 09 03:20:57 <PassportPowell>	ahhh something to do with the way it shows balances?
Oct 09 03:21:01 <newtwo_>	takes a while to register
Oct 09 03:21:05 <rm3>	paper gains, did u see the tokens?
Oct 09 03:21:10 <newtwo_>	yeah, some tokens dont reflect a dollar amount
Oct 09 03:21:33 <newtwo_>	sometimes when you LP it will show
Oct 09 03:21:37 <PassportPowell>	It was a while ago but i think i remember seeing the totals going from 100k to over 1m at one point
Oct 09 03:21:40 <mariarahel>	the reason the asset becomes a security is because the facilities that stabilize and maintain its price exceeds the threshhold for sane tax-reportable things that are set up so as to skip reporting
Oct 09 03:23:12 <PassportPowell>	ok let's switch up a little unless anyone else has questions or you want to comment on anything specific
Oct 09 03:23:26 <PassportPowell>	How/when did you get into coding ND CRYPTO
Oct 09 03:23:31 <PassportPowell>	and crypto*
Oct 09 03:24:02 <PassportPowell>	You have a lot of knowledge, it's very intriguing
Oct 09 03:25:07 <Tetragrammaton414>	Is your background mostly in coding, or in mathematics?
Oct 09 03:25:13 <Tetragrammaton414>	Or finance?
Oct 09 03:25:47 <Guest2661>	^
Oct 09 03:25:55 <newtwo_>	I was wondering about the next phase mentioned, in observing and stabelizing. what does that entail? is there functions in place to make that happen? or is it more of a sitback and observe?
Oct 09 03:26:03 <rm3>	Are u a guy or a gal? Lol
Oct 09 03:26:05 <jack>	Hi @mariarahel , good morning. I finally have you online. I got 1 question, You have kept bill burr token separately in the addresses list in GitHub. I also see 1 of the person pretty much holding 85% of the supply including LPs for that. Is there something peculiar about that contract to list separately?
Oct 09 03:26:06 <newtwo_>	also, is there any Ai involved with any of the tokens
Oct 09 03:26:16 <Ra>	Keeping track of taxes in crypto is very difficult. Since pulsechain is relatively new, it seems third party services (koinly etc.) cannot yet process most of the transactions. Are people doing 1000s of transaction calculations manually?
Oct 09 03:26:51 <mariarahel>	I plan on getting those portions of the Bill Burr token that I still hold to him at some point

Oct 09 03:27:25 <jack>	Haha ..nice
Oct 09 03:27:30 <mariarahel>	ya we gotta keep him
Oct 09 03:27:47 <newtwo_>	Also, do you have any position or connection with Anthropic, that you can speak of?
Oct 09 03:27:52 <PassportPowell>	SENS foundation should test longevity on him
Oct 09 03:28:29 <jack>	Yup that sounds great but is there anything peculiar about that contract that you listed it separately?
Oct 09 03:29:28 <Tetragrammaton414>	So no questions about background then. Speaking of the last big pump with the 414 coins - Do you feel like it went just as expected, or did it go up too quick, and thus dumped quickly also? Do you speculate much on the pumps/dumps and why they happen, and when?
Oct 09 03:29:49 <PassportPowell>	Yeah i noticed that, I was going to move on lol
Oct 09 03:31:50 <jack>	I see reference of atropa in your dating way back. How long have you been working on atropa or you intended to create something like this?
Oct 09 03:32:27 <midnightmadwalk>	Hello
Oct 09 03:32:33 <moose_>	You mentioned that the bots were what caused the crash last week but what has to be put in place to cause a pump externally from buy pressure from humans

Oct 09 15:44:29 <hhyyll>	Good question
Oct 09 15:45:08 <hhyyll>	How pdai can stabilise at 1 $
Oct 09 15:45:11 <DTA73>	how can we help?
Oct 09 15:45:46 <hhyyll>	DTA73: if you can grab me some mcdonald
Oct 09 15:45:52 <Tbill>	That's the big question we agree on is it could easily go to a dollar but is there enough capital to collateralize the token is what people speculate on

Oct 09 19:52:09 <newtwo_>	@mariarahel Do you see implementation of price oracles in the future? This seems to be an important piece of the roadmap for stables. Can you comment on any information or knowledge you may have surrounding this topic?
Oct 09 19:52:48 <mariarahel>	i'm really not familiar with how that concept operations in solidity
Oct 09 19:53:24 <newtwo_>	@mariarahel Also, are there any plans for logos/icons for the tokens? Specifically, Atropa and some of the other more popular tokens. I feel it would increase interest in the ecosystem to have official icons.
Oct 09 19:53:53 <PassportPowell>	<mariarahel> When if pools open do you think any 414 tokens will be added to it on pulsex?
Oct 09 19:54:06 <mariarahel>	I have negotiations open with artists but no direction or coordination as of yet for the visual stuff

Oct 09 19:55:47 <newtwo_>	If ok, i might send some icon samples ive designed. I dont need any compensation for them. Ive already designed quite a few, while making my Atropa Eco map...lol
Oct 09 19:55:53 <hextrack>	As far as im aware oracles are basically just a contract of verified and trusted price feeds that it takes the average of
Oct 09 19:55:59 <mariarahel>	the Bullion5 is convertible directly in 1111111111:1 ratio for Bullion8 and will at some point in the future be purchased back and converted to Bullion8 permanently

Oct 09 19:59:48 <FREEDOM_Tokens777>	mariarahel: the visual aspect and logos/imagery is very important to people and people create meaning from it
Oct 09 20:00:01 <newtwo_>	the public definitely gets turned off by 666 supply. I figure this may be a type of warning to not buy that token?
Oct 09 20:00:30 <PassportPowell>	I thought that too

Oct 09 20:12:50 <newtwo_>	@mariarahel Can you elaborate on the choice of the name Atropa? Is it to represent the nightshade plant spieces? Or is it in reference to Atropos. Im leaning more towards Atropos, as the meaning would be very fitting. Or maybe it is something else? The reason I ask, is so I might have proper inspiration when designing potential artwork.
