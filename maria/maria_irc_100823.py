            [2:58pm] JJ76: Mathematicians speaking How long will it take for pDAI to peg to a $1? Assuming that's the goal. Correct me if I'm wrong .
            [2:59pm] Simple: Maria do you see an inbound recovery coming for the WritingContract since it‚Äôs 90% dip? Since the violent dip in certain coins could be viewed as mainly over, will we see recoveries? or will there be new tokens taking over the tiles of the older ones?
            [2:59pm] Choicey left the chat room. (Quit: Page closed)
            [2:59pm] mariarahel: that will be bought back regularly over time as I hit success points

            [3:00pm] robin_: Es como una telenovela tengo ganas de mas Acertijos
            [3:00pm] Simple: your success points are measured in gradual stability of the overall system?
            [3:00pm] JJ76: Maria, does kymato play a role in atropa ecosystem and if so what role does kymato play in the atropa system?
            [3:00pm] mariarahel: the next stage is stability and steady growth
            [3:00pm] newtwo_: quick question. was it you that reduced Atropa supply to 069? Is there plans in the future to burn more Atropa supply?
            [3:00pm] mariarahel: i don't know what kymato is
            [3:01pm] moose_: Maria by steady growth are you referring to a similar climb to the period between August 1st - August 17th?
            [3:01pm] mariarahel: the 1mil burn on atropa was meant to set an early bar for the amount of holdings I expected in top holders
            [3:01pm] mariarahel: there are a bunch over 1mil currently but I expect that number will drop as the value goes up
            [3:02pm] newtwo_: I am refereing to the 42 Atropa that was burned about a week ago
            [3:02pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: mariarahel: I talked to Kymato Dev yesterday they reached out to me from this chat, they're trying to support pDAI along with you üëç
            [3:02pm] newtwo_: the supply is now 1,111,111,069
            [3:02pm] mariarahel: i had not noticed, no i don't know who burned those

            [3:04pm] SwissAlpen1 joined the chat room.
            [3:04pm] Simple: is PUNK, WAR, GRILL mintable coins? do you have any plans to mint those or could we build communities around them similar to teddy and monat?
            [3:04pm] juice_: Maria, do you have plans for wbtc as well??
            [3:04pm] ccc: where is the summary? is that the one on rentry.co?
            [3:04pm] mariarahel: TSFi is the asset I personally recommend because it's most likely to return the largest profit on the smallest short term investment
            [3:04pm] Tetragrammaton: Maria - Was that you doing the Current 93 cover on soundcloud? Found it while researching last week. lol
            [3:04pm] PassportPowell: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/2fvq58i2gouor5yybpugy/PassportPowell-atropa-2.log?rlkey=b4l7rrnz2wfsvgxyom3th9a6r&dl=0up to when you asked #ccc
            [3:05pm] mariarahel: the Teddy Bear is possibly stronger for a large investment but I presume anyone putting that much into the system can do their own research
            [3:05pm] midnightmadwalk: do you recognize me ? we exchanged emails
            [3:05pm] newtwo_: Maria, when you created a few different tokens, you sent 1 to kymato token, 1 to Jedi Master, and 1 to pickle... what is the significance?
            [3:05pm] PassportPowell: HI Mariarahel Do you have any plans for RH birthday? in terms of anything on the blockchain?
            [3:06pm] Tetragrammaton: Powell are you cataloging all of these chats, or is that just the one from last night?
            [3:06pm] mariarahel: the wbtc liquidities were added as a group effort, i'm waiting to see how that does
            [3:06pm] newtwo_: Also, why do certain token addresses hold LP?
            [3:06pm] midnightmadwalk: Monat money ?
            [3:06pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: mariarahel: what are your thoughts on Providing Liquidity to your ecosystem with either a Pulse/414 pair, or a 414/414 pair?

            [3:07pm] SwissAlpen1: yep its RH birthday tomorrow, I only know as I share that day with him, I am blessed to do so!
            [3:07pm] PassportPowell: I then run it through Ai to pull out maria key points

            [3:07pm] ogwebchef888: Gets 9 hhFa minted when call public function
            [3:07pm] mariarahel: the lp holdings on renounced tokens is purely symbolic, rather than sending the locked liquidities to 0xdead it translates into a more meaningful way to represent why the liquidities are locked and what the tockens and their utilities are supposed to represent

            [3:08pm] Simple: what are your plans for the Annabelle contract?
            [3:08pm] midnightmadwalk: Scary
            [3:08pm] juice_: Also, what is the plan for this coin. CA: 0xFa4d9C6E012d946853386113ACbF166deC5465Bb. It's symbol is attached to many of the large tokens in this ecosystem and has a decent pool with wbtc.
            [3:08pm] PassportPowell: <mariarahel> DO you work alone? If not how many people directly do you work with?

            [3:10pm] ogwebchef888: ü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Ø
            [3:10pm] Suave: @mariarahel WHAT IS YOUR GOAL?
            [3:10pm] mariarahel: the 0xFa token is designed to fit the definition for a "Legal Tender" because of the way it is derived
            [3:11pm] ead11: mariarahel:  have you considered making a dex token with emissions still using plsx router of course but a platform that encourages others to make lp and a use case for staking pls/pdai  pdai/atropa long term ?
            [3:11pm] mariarahel: the tokens names of everything in the system is intended to fit specific definitions used in financial instrumentation

            [3:12pm] Kizz left the chat room.
            [3:12pm] mariarahel: i'm trying to keep it simpler and none of my tokens will ever support custodial staking of any kind.  I believe there is likely to be a case in the future for additional tokens that support issuance based on approval and transfer criteria
            [3:13pm] midnightmadwalk: Excellent
            [3:13pm] Kizz joined the chat room.
            [3:13pm] midnightmadwalk: ‚ò∫Ô∏è

            [3:13pm] Kizz: Wow, I made it
            [3:13pm] mariarahel: i think a lot of us have been through enough token swaps to realize that is where a lot of coins go wrong
            [3:13pm] moose_: Maria by next stage of steady growth and stability are you referring to a similar climb to the price action period between August 1st - August 17th?
            [3:13pm] newtwo_: What is the purpose of the MV token? is it to continuously generate volume? It seems kind of like a penny tray...need a penny, take a penny...
            [3:13pm] Suave: @mariarahel Is your plan to bring pDAI to 1 USD?
            [3:14pm] SwissAlpen1: maria, how do we convince the sceptical Pulsechain influencers of your credibility so we can all work together and not against each other. We would work so much better with them on our side.
            [3:14pm] Kizz: Hello chat hello maria
            [3:14pm] mariarahel: my expectation is that as richard wraps up the SEC stuff and it goes in his favor, and we see demonstrable stability in the pulsechain network, the forces that be will drive up prices across the board
            [3:14pm] _grav: MV seems to be tied to Beats (gas)?

            [3:15pm] Tetragrammaton: *reasked

            [3:15pm] snowflake: @mariarahel - what is the purpose of sending supply to other contract addresses? Does it lock that supply?
            [3:15pm] PassportPowell: <mariarahel> What are some things we do to help with the next stage of stability and growth?
            [3:15pm] mariarahel: the handful of openly mintable tokens are intended to help burn pls and test an experiment for tokens of lowest value
            [3:16pm] newtwo_: interesting
            [3:16pm] _grav: Like XEN?
            [3:16pm] iii71 is now known as ii71.
            [3:16pm] mariarahel: sending the LP tokens to 0xdead or to any renounced contract address locks that liquidity permanently, yes
            [3:16pm] Mav_ joined the chat room.
            [3:16pm] mariarahel: the balance can be bought out but never withdrawn
            [3:16pm] Nightshade: hi Maria, the mintable tokens ... are they mintable by anyone who knows how to or do any minted tokens only go to the addresses in the contract?
            [3:16pm] JJ76: mariarahel: when you say you think tsfi will have the best short term gains, are you speaking in terms of tsfi against USD, PLS, or Atropa?
            [3:16pm] ItaloDisco: Maria can you tell us something about Bullion5 and Bullion8?
            [3:17pm] newtwo_: does TSFi stand for T Share Finance?
            [3:17pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: mariarahel: awesome !
            [3:17pm] Devi_ joined the chat room.
            [3:17pm] mariarahel: the mints are mixed, i don't honestly recommend minting anything but the FPMB token because the profit margin calculations are too hard
            [3:17pm] Nightshade: perfect, thank you
            [3:17pm] mariarahel: but if the tokens required to issue 1 FPMB cost less than the bond is worth, then it should encourage issuance
            [3:18pm] newtwo_: what about issuing bond for ﬁñﬁÆﬁîﬁ®ﬁêﬁ∞ﬁãﬁ≠ﬁàﬁØﬁÄﬁ©?

            [3:18pm] midnightmadwalk: like writing
            [3:18pm] Kizz: What‚Äôs the plan for pWbtc since the rd is lower than eth version?
            [3:18pm] midnightmadwalk: ü§£
            [3:18pm] SwissAlpen1: Maria, we have seen a lot of new wallets onboarded with the pdai peggening , and also huge amounts from teddy bear. Are we better to concentrate on a specific narrative or risk spreading to thin on many?
            [3:19pm] juice_: Maria, when you say steady growth, would you compare this to the period of August 1st - August 17th
            [3:19pm] Jack_: Any plans for pLUSD?
            [3:19pm] midnightmadwalk: you are not free to go
            [3:19pm] mariarahel: the play distribution in the assets that receive the most interest will influence how the push forward will occur for further development on the ecosystem
            [3:19pm] Kizz: *Ts. Total supply not rd
            [3:20pm] mariarahel: the IRC token was created to represent that I feel ready about the ecosystem completeness to declare it stable enough to receive comments
            [3:20pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: Maria, what is your favorite token in your ecosystem and why ? Not from a monetary perspective but is there any one of them that has alot more meaning to you than the others ?
            [3:21pm] newtwo_: Atropa haha the BEAST
            [3:21pm] JJ76: Are you a fan of the video game hyper light drifter?
            [3:21pm] midnightmadwalk: Push whole ecosystem not just one token that should out agenda right now lol
            [3:21pm] mariarahel: i don't play games or make bets
            [3:21pm] JJ76: Boom!
            [3:22pm] Suave: Maria What's your plan with pdai?
            [3:22pm] JJ76: Awesome. I quit that as well thanks to RH and his advice
            [3:22pm] SHVDXW9: gm
            [3:22pm] BigPoppy: Do you believe having Teddy Bear bridged to ETH will be beneficial long term. Would it help to have more liquidity in it?
            [3:22pm] juice_: Maria, when you say steady growth, would you compare this to the period of August 1st - August 17th
            [3:22pm] Simple: yeah but there‚Äôs are gigantic fear about the mint ability of tokens, and therefor people are too scared to push tokens in the eco system
            [3:22pm] JBSmooth: Maria, Thanks for your hard work! In your opinion do you feel that the atropa ecosystem will be one of the main catalyst for this upcoming bullrun and may likely lead the way?
            [3:22pm] midnightmadwalk: I shared FPMB experience in your inbox maybe if you have little time check it out @mariarahel
            [3:23pm] mariarahel: i think we are making a case for the best investment in crypto
            [3:23pm] ii71: lfg..
            [3:23pm] Tetragrammaton: It's amazing to see someone who is equally a fan of crypto development, finance, Magick, kpop, and the Swans. truly fascinating
            [3:23pm] _grav: wow.
            [3:23pm] mariarahel: if that proves true then we'll see improved asset inflow
            [3:23pm] Guest2631: Should I name my first born Atropa or pDai?
            [3:23pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: YES!!!
            [3:23pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: Lfggg
            [3:23pm] Suave: Which of the 100s token is the best investment lol
            [3:23pm] midnightmadwalk: What is dysnomia?
            [3:24pm] _grav: maria where does the name Atropa come from to you?
            [3:24pm] newtwo_: Can you specify any plans for front end applications you may be working on? Wallet, Portfolio, Dex etc...?
            [3:24pm] moose_: Maria should I sell my house for more pDAI?
            [3:24pm] Simple: capital could be flowing in if there would be more clarifications for normal people about mintable coins. investors are hesitant
            [3:24pm] mariarahel: dysnomia is a math proof, if all goes well it will be integrated as a sidechain that stores hook contracts on pulsechain for off-chain peer to peer interactions
            [3:24pm] PassportPowell: jheeeze
            [3:24pm] mariarahel: i'm not clear on what the utilities will be yet
            [3:24pm] SwissAlpen1: Atropa if a girl Pdai for a boy?
            [3:25pm] Devi_: Hi Maria, I see you have tied liquidity to pWBTC. I feel it‚Äôs greatly undervalued at the moment. Do you have furthers plans for pWBTc?
            [3:25pm] mariarahel: i would like to see CAW finished

            [3:26pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: CAW is a token in Ethereum that was funded eth by the Shiba Inu deployer
            [3:26pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: Big mystery token
            [3:26pm] mariarahel: we don't have any good UX examples for blockchain based functions outside of pure profit making
            [3:27pm] JJ76: It's decentralized Twitter . From what I've been told
            [3:27pm] SwissAlpen1: Maria,

            [3:31pm] mariarahel: that's designed to set up the whole outlook, the profit potential for jumping into a token with a lot of locked liquidities of other tokens likely to go up in value and a very low number of holders at all is literally most likely to return the best profit on a random buy

            [3:34pm] moose_: @mariahel can you explain why pDAI and USDC are pegged 1:1 together? and USDT lags behind?
            [3:34pm] mariarahel: the ethereum liquidities will come later
            [3:35pm] mariarahel: as I understand, the 3 pulseStable assets are controlled by 3 distinct entities with the DAI & USDC teams being more closely linked together and the USDT team being more tied to bitcoin
            [3:35pm] Guest2631: Will we have a merry Christmas i
            [3:35pm] _grav: lol
            [3:35pm] midnightmadwalk: @moose_: check maker dao things we can easily swap between usdc and dai and not usdt
            [3:35pm] juice_: How will the system work to hold dai at a dollar once it gets there
            [3:36pm] mariarahel: i chose DAI as the primary asset to lock liquidity with because it vibes best with the project

            [3:37pm] newtwo_: yes, lots of us willing to help the project
            [3:37pm] JBSmooth: @mariarahel- Easy one for you, Do you wholeheartedly believe that the atropa ecosystem that you created is safe and sound for investors? Thanks in advance
            [3:37pm] mariarahel: I see the next few days as a settling out period, I'm taking note of questions and interest levels and watching stability on the system

            [3:38pm] mariarahel: I think that the locked liquidities pattern and the active holders distribution clears the Atropa oriented tokens as the best investment in crypto today
            [3:38pm] newtwo_: i think the best way to help is to swap haha...bswapping is your vote

            [3:41pm] mariarahel: i am interested in any mock-up ideas for how anyone might like to see the data presented in a client.  My idea is to show information about the atropa token and liquidity pools and provide easy access to copy contract addresses

            [3:42pm] Strixer: @mariarahel Looking at holders and cocked liquidityd, DOWN looks identical to TSFI, what are the reasons you recommend TSFI over dOWN when it is already 2x the market cap?

            [3:42pm] catten joined the chat room.
            [3:42pm] mariarahel: I know that what is most wanted is a client-concept that allows anybody to easily buy in at like a $5-$20 level and then immediately be able to view depth about their investment options and swap around easily
            [3:42pm] Guest2631: Are you planning on releasing many more 414 tokens?
            [3:43pm] pulseperza: Who doesn't love data lol
            [3:43pm] Strixer: {locked liquidity
            [3:43pm] zyon: I think for more people to onboard a UI where the LP connections are somehow visualized and made easier to swap to different tokens in the ecosystem, would be very helpful.
            [3:43pm] PassportPowell: Do you have any association with @FourOneFour on X/twitter
            [3:43pm] pulseperza: Solid question
            [3:43pm] mariarahel: i don't use any social media

            [3:44pm] midnightmadwalk:  Visualize it as a game where what you bought is becomes a character  and we can move it around.
            [3:44pm] mariarahel: it's the lottery-ticket crowd where the money is at

            [3:45pm] zyon: Crowd or crows?
            [3:45pm] PassportPowell: Not sure if you answered this but did you haveanything to do with the makerdoa vote for the pDAI contract?
            [3:45pm] PassportPowell: If yes what was the vote for exactly?
            [3:45pm] mariarahel: i don't follow anything but hex very closely
            [3:45pm] TreasuryBill: Maria can you explain why you only renounce a few tokens upon deoploying
            [3:46pm] TreasuryBill: Those would be very bullish also bullish tokens include ones you can read lol considering 90% are unreadable
            [3:46pm] PassportPowell: are you a HEX og?
            [3:46pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: mariarahel: thank-you for stating that.
            [3:46pm] mariarahel: the tokens that are not renounced are intended to have open transfer options later, only the treasury bill contract has a mint function on it though

            [3:46pm] MichaelT: @Maria  you say there are separate "Teams" for pUSDC and pUSDT, have you been in contact with them to coordinate with pDAI?

            [3:47pm] Guest2631: like RH?
            [3:48pm] zyon: You just referred to a lottery ticket crowd. Did you refer to the token CROWS?
            [3:48pm] TreasuryBill: Interesting response lol
            [3:48pm] Simple: mariarahel it would be so awesome if we had an official list from you on what tokens a can be minted into infinity and which couldn‚Äôt.. I can‚Äôt be the only one wondering about this.. we literally have tons of people on standby just waiting to be part of something big, but we‚Äôre all scared because we don‚Äôt want to get dumped on by minters.
            [3:48pm] TreasuryBill: It‚Äôs interesting considering nobody has yet to perfect a reflection token would be revolutionary imo
            [3:48pm] midnightmadwalk: A1A tho
            [3:49pm] _grav: B2B tho
            [3:49pm] mariarahel: i think the ecosystem has covered all the various trust models that currency backers play
            [3:49pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: Token A....and Token B!!!
            [3:49pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: lol
            [3:49pm] TreasuryBill: Every reflection dies never seen one make it past multiple cycles that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs a very bullish tomencomic concept that has yet to be perfected
            [3:50pm] mariarahel: that was the goal on having more than 1 token from the launch
            [3:50pm] _grav: the youtube playlist has 200 videos, any connection?
            [3:50pm] TreasuryBill: I understand‚Ä¶ I like hoes tokenomics lol genius
            [3:50pm] iTz_Black007: maria, what is that git repo purpose what it's building? like any Roadmap if possible
            [3:51pm] midnightmadwalk: @TreasuryBill: maybe check A1A for your answer.
            [3:51pm] mariarahel: the Atropa token was initially divided into a hedge fund TSFI, a work fund LOL, the savings account dOWN, and then the LEGAL contract was set up as the initial non-mintable lock device
            [3:51pm] ItaloDisco: Maria any comments on Bullion 5 and Bullion 8?
            [3:51pm] TreasuryBill: How do you plan on collateralizing pDai when I goes to one dollar considering people have 10s of millions
            [3:51pm] newtwo_: wow, that is freakin cool
            [3:52pm] PassportPowell: What were the reasons behind making your github repo public instead of private?
            [3:52pm] mariarahel: those two should be trading at a 1111111111:1 ratio which is currently exploitable
            [3:52pm] ead11: Rewards from taxes isn't distributed back to lp only holders
            [3:52pm] FREEDOM_Tokens777: midnightmadwalk: Sunny's Token!! My boy. He missing out rn.

            [3:53pm] TreasuryBill: Maria will How‚Äôs go to 1 Trillion dollar mkt?
            [3:53pm] midnightmadwalk: closer to their pegs by incentivizing participants to sell above-peg stablecoins and purchase below-peg ones.
            [3:53pm] Mav_: @maria how confident are you that pDai can reach and maintain peg at $1?
            [3:53pm] mariarahel: the tokenized assets are a most primitive demo of content-frame specific assets for client development
