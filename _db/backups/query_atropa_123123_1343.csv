4292,"2023-10-11 08:47:00","#atropa","_surfacing8671_","the best example would be to think of pdai now as an algorithmic stable coin. but with out the algorythim haha. so you need to create a market place so that whe someone burns the token they also get something that they want in return. like actual trade"
4290,"2023-10-11 08:46:00","#atropa","_surfacing8671_","so like sell nfts for pdai and all of the pdai is burned"

4289,"2023-10-11 08:45:00","#atropa","_surfacing8671_","well its all psychological then isnt it. how does the usdc hold peg? someone gives circle 1 dollor in exchange for 1 usdc. meaning there is a 1 to 1 in the bank to make it equal to 1 dollar. so one thing that the pdai has going for it is that currently, i could be wrong here, but currently there is no way to mint the token. making it non-elastic. so it has a finite supply. the best way to hold the peg would be to give a way to burn the token as wel"
